# OpenSourceLLMTools

A set of tools I made with open source LLMs from Hugging Face

# Pipelines

pipelines do pre and post processing on input data

# Training Models

To train a vision model like donut you need images with corresponding json files. The json files will contain the expected output you want from the model

Once you have all the data you will need to pre process the data to be ingested by the model

First step for images would be to conver them into the size and color format your model expects, for Donut this is RGB.
