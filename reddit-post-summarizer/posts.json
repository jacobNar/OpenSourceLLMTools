I\\'m looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up.</p> <p>There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they\\'d be complicated to use - I\\'d be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I\\'d forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made.</p> <p>Something like this would be pretty much perfect: <a href=\"https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr#\">https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr#</a> - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there\\'s no &quot;hidden state&quot; - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don\\'t have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don\\'t really want next to my bed. (I don\\'t mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don\\'t want a constant noise)</p> <p>I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn\\'t change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want.</p> <p>Something like this <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3\">https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3</a> looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote &quot;<em>It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all</em>&quot; and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don\\'t have full words on them. I have no idea what &quot;CD&quot; means in that context. Another reviewer said &quot;<em>I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc.</em>&quot; It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn\\'t be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep.</p> <p>I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there\\'s a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it.</p> <p>Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BarneyLaurance\"> /u/BarneyLaurance </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doesthisexist/comments/1mnclxm/silent_plug_in_timer_switch_with_simple_interface/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doesthisexist/comments/1mnclxm/silent_plug_in_timer_switch_with_simple_interface/\">[comments]</a></span>'}]",

Instead of swiping endlessly on people with no context, HUE helps you meet, date, and make friends with others who share (or are curious about) your cultural background. You can connect with people from 20+ different ethnicities, explore prompts that highlight identity &amp; interests, and join group chats to build real communities.</p> <p><strong>Why did I build this?</strong> As a Nigerian American in the diaspora, I’ve always loved Nigerian culture - Afrobeats, Nollywood, and everything in between - but I realized I didn’t have a big enough community around me to share that love with. That gap inspired me to create HUE. I wanted a space where people could celebrate who they are, meet others who share their interests, and form relationships rooted in authenticity.</p> <p><strong>Why HUE is different:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Culture-first profiles (show who you are &amp; where you’re from)<br /></li> <li>Meet people for friendship, dating, or networking<br /></li> <li>Group chats to easily form communities with the people you’ve connected with<br /></li> <li>Built-in icebreakers so conversations flow naturally<br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Download link (iOS):</strong> 👉<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hue-dating-friends-culture/id6473274994\"> HUE on the App Store</a></p> <p>This is still early, so any feedback is super appreciated.

Since this group has many businesses I wanted to share my observations. </p> <p>I started by looking for something in a very specific niche but after talking to few sellers and looking at an exorbitant ask, I decided to expand and look at similar businesses. I don’t have any personal connections with a business so these have all been interactions with strangers (sellers I found on broker websites). In total I have now looked at 16 businesses seriously (over 100 overall). </p> <p>Here goes: </p> <p>Almost 90/100 times - the business is overvalued - not just a little over but really overvalued - think $500k ask = $250k reality. A lot of them are getting this number from metric calculator or AI. They choose 1-2 years maybe 10 years ago to demonstrate “profitability”. Often, sellers are not realistic unless they genuinely engage with the buyer. Also, they often come up with numbers based on an upcoming life goal. Like a ladies kids were graduating and she wanted $79k for their tuition so she was adamant on the price. It had nothing to do with the books. Remember, you’re not here to buy someone’s retirement home. </p> <p>Brokers are the worse- at least the 29 of them I’ve interacted with. None of them come from finance and multiples are pulled from the magic hat. A lot of them misrepresent. There is a hands off business (absentee owner) floating on business for sale. When you talk to the manager- you find out he’s the owners father. For first time sellers- brokers also set up lots of call to show you that you have so many people interested but they don’t wet sellers and sometimes don’t tell the seller what the business is about. They do this so you don’t bring down the price. Know that a lot of buyers you’re meeting may not know everything about your operations because they are told - “seller does not want to release anything till you talk to them”. However, if they know you’re in the industry or have bought before - they are usually nicer (based on my friends experience not mine). </p> <p>10/100 sellers don’t want to sell. They are just browsing to see what’s the market and who will pay for their ask (a random number from their magic hat). These are usually sellers- who will just talk, ask for a number and won’t ever send you any documents or will send a screenshot from some excel for one year (3 years ago) where the business made $$$. Tip: don’t waste your time if they don’t have books.</p> <p>10/100 sellers are actually selling for legit reasons. Retirement, relocation and ill health are the most common legit reasons. These sellers are hard to find. </p> <p>Most sellers ask for projections and potential of the business. Like skin care is a billion dollar industry. They make 100k/year and ask is $5mil- because it’s a billion dollar industry. </p> <p>Most pull potential and expansion plans from Google- like pay more for more marketing, add more sales people etc. etc. - if it was true, they’d have done it. </p> <p>A lot of businesses are bleeding money- you need to know where to look. Someone on Reddit mentioned this when I first started research and I didn’t take it seriously. I was fixated on clean books. But now I know better- ask about every expense in the books. It doesn’t matter whether it’s $1 or $10k. Even small things like hidden memberships, trade shows etc. - ask for proof or Google to see if they were in attendance etc. </p> <p>Accountants and lawyers will only give you advise- they won’t negotiate for you. You have to be proactive. Ties into - #7 - a stationary receipt is an expense but not for a business that’s pressure washing- dig and you’ll find it could be their child’s back to school stuff. It’s fine for a few expenses here and there but you should know where it’s coming from. </p> <p>Make seller transition exhaustive- paying 6figures? Don’t take a one week or one month transition. You won’t learn anything. Unless you’re a pro from the same industry. If the business has been running for 2 years - ask for 60 days and add a business that ran for 10 years - ask for 6 months. Don’t be flexible. Sellers disappear if they’re not obligated by the agreement. Also, be fair - don’t exploit their time. </p> <p>Service businesses- clients could be tied to the personal goodwill of the seller. Can’t elaborate more as I didn’t look too deep in this. </p> <p>Don’t pay what you can’t handle. Know your budget. Know that when you buy- you’ll need to enter and clean house to make it profitable. That money can’t go to the Seller. It’s like buying a house- qualifying for the mortgage is different from buying furniture when you get the house. Don’t take out loans - you can’t payback. Don’t over leverage. It’s not worth it. The best value is to ask yourself- can I do a better job starting this with money I have versus paying it to the seller- if yes don’t buy it. Buying a Business should help you skip a few steps and get ahead faster - not something that leaves you recovering for years. </p> <p>While you don’t need to be super passionate- you do need to know what you’re doing and like it. If you’re not technical (like me) don’t look at SaaS- it’s a waste. Don’t think you can outsource everything. People will take you for a ride. </p> <p>Good sellers (based on positive experiences): </p> <p>They want to work with you. They will be more reasonable if you point out issues politely. They want their brand to continue beyond them- you can tell from their voice and passion that they want the business to succeed after them- they will try their best to set you up for success. These are the nicest sellers. </p> <p>They’ll tell you when they made a mistake - yes they don’t want you to mess up so they’ll tell you what they tried and why it didn’t work. </p> <p>They want to be included for a while with the transition- they don’t want to dump it on you and run the next day. </p> <p>They are open to creative ways of financing if they like you (not always true- sometimes they do need the money). </p> <p>They care about long term employees. </p> <p>Lessons: Don’t buy a business on autopilot- it doesn’t exist. Don’t buy a single owner operated business- like crafts or custom work unless you know the skill. Don’t be attached to the business before you close. Talk to the seller. Listings can be deceiving. Walk if you don’t like them- it’s not worth the hassle. Pay what you’re comfortable with not for potential, cash money etc. If you can start it and make it succeed faster then don’t pay for it- do it. Don’t buy a business to quit a job. </p> <p>If you’re a seller what has your experience been? I am curious. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Calgarianexplorer\"> /u/Calgarianexplorer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mxcydk/buying_a_business_what_i_learnt_the_hard_way/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mxcydk/buying_a_business_what_i_learnt_the_hard_way/\">[comments]</a></span>'}]",

They don’t just drive direct sales they start the journey that fuels your entire revenue ecosystem.</p> <p>A quick example: We worked with a brand that thought Facebook ads “weren’t working” because their dashboard showed a weaker ROAS. They pulled the plug. </p> <p>Within 2 weeks: • Google search traffic fell by 30%!! (fewer people searching the brand after first seeing an ad). • Amazon sales dipped 25% (shoppers weren’t being introduced to the brand in the first place). • Email revenue slowed (no new leads coming in to nurture). On the surface, ads looked unprofitable. But when you zoom out, they were the gasoline keeping the whole engine running. Why this happens: • Attribution delay → Platforms rarely show you the full picture of how long people take to buy. • Channel crossover → Most buyers don’t buy where they first see you. They jump between Meta, Google, Amazon, TikTok, email, etc. • First-touch vs. last-touch → Ads often create the demand, but other channels capture the sale.</p> <p>The takeaway: Before you kill ads, ask: • What happens to my organic, Amazon, or Google sales without them? • Am I measuring only last-click ROAS, or am I looking at contribution to the whole business? New customer acquisition etc. • Do I have a testing window long enough to see lifetime value, not just week-one sales?</p> <p>Feel like you can relate?

I\\'d prefer fully online coursework, but I would also <strong>highly</strong> value the strength of the networking opportunities, since this is currently a weak point for me. Any insights on the pros / cons of the two options below would be greatly appreciated. </p> <p>Background: I have an undergraduate degree in cybersecurity, and will complete an MS in Cybersecurity Management &amp; Policy soon. This is at an online school (UMGC), which does not have a strong alumni networking presence even here in the DMW. Certified Scrum Master, Advanced Certified Scrum Master, and I\\'ll most likely have the PMP this year, but nothing specifically product-focused. Undergrad GPA is terrible, grad school GPA is 4.0 so far. I also have three cybersecurity certs in my pipeline for this year, but as with my degree, nothing product-specific. </p> <p>Option 1: UIUC\\'s MS. Management or MBA. The MSM degree stacks into the MBA if I wanted to add that next year. Business degree from a strong engineering school, great global alumni network (they have alumni meetups here in DC, alumni are engaged and available to chat with prospective students, everyone I\\'ve talked to has repeatedly mention the value of mentorship, job referrals, etc). Has an opportunity for an annual in-person alumni networking event that everyone raves about, plus in-person project groups at US and international locations once or twice a year. This is a general-purpose management degree. The global exposure and networks are of interest me as much of my career has been international, and I\\'m extremely interested in working internationally again in the future. </p> <p>Option 2: University of Maryland\\'s Product Management Master\\'s. Also a great engineering school. Uncertain how engaged or active the alumni network is for referrals, but here in the DMV where the next several years of my career will be, UMD grads are absolutely <strong>everywhere.</strong> Very good local reputation. I\\'m also just outside campus and on their shuttle route, so it\\'d be really nice to be back in an academic environment again, have access to student groups, have spaces to work or work out, and just be more engaged and out of my house, even though the program itself is entirely online. The professor who founded the program did an in-depth career call with me, was extremely well-prepared, and is someone I\\'d love to have as a mentor or in my network. I\\'ve attended a couple of their alumni presentations as well, and they\\'re impressive people. This is a much more focused degree specifically on product management. </p> <p>Thoughts?

Couldn’t afford courses, so I lived on free tutorials Abdul Bari for data structures, random channels for algorithms, anything I could find.</p> <p><strong>Here’s the painful part</strong>: I’d binge-watch tutorials all weekend, feel like I finally “got it,” and then two days later… complete blank. Like my brain treated it as entertainment, not learning.</p> <p><strong>My cycle became</strong>:</p> <p>watch → feel enlightened → forget → screenshot slides → throw them at ChatGPT → get half-baked answers → feel dumb → repeat.</p> <p>By January, I snapped. I was tired of pretending I was learning when I wasn’t , felt like I was fooling myself into thinking I was studying when I was just... watching.</p> <p><strong>So I built Haash-LM out of frustration</strong>.</p> <p>Started with Gemini’s free API (student budget = broke).</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong>: it only handled local videos.</p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong> hacked together yt-dlp + frame sampling so I could feed YouTube videos into the model without burning tokens.</p> <p>Then April hit. <strong>Google AI Studio</strong> launched official YouTube support. My heart sank months of work gone.</p> <p><strong>But plot twist:</strong> their method burns 700–800k tokens for a 40-min video. My “desperate engineering” approach? ~150k tokens for 90 minutes can understand full visual context with less token counts ( i.e,. can ask about anything visually around the whole video ). Turns out constraints made me design something leaner. </p> <p><strong>But here\\'s what makes it truly different</strong> - after Google\\'s launch, I realized I needed something unique. I brainstormed about my other core problem: people like me who learn CS concepts through YouTube tutorials don\\'t actually practice what they watch.</p> <p>I researched online code execution APIs and discovered <strong>Judge0 through RapidAPI</strong>. </p> <p>That\\'s when it clicked - the real problem wasn\\'t just understanding videos, it was never practicing what I learned.</p> <p>The platform works with any YouTube video from any domain, but I added special features for coding tutorials:</p> <ul> <li>AI-powered coding exercises generated from actual video content</li> <li>Live code execution environment built right in</li> <li>Custom practice problems that match what you\\'re watching</li> <li>Immediate hands-on coding without switching platforms</li> </ul> <p><strong>The result?</strong> I finally broke the binge-watch cycle:</p> <p>Instead of passively watching → actively practicing</p> <p>Instead of forgetting everything → actually retaining concepts</p> <p>Instead of feeling smart then stupid → building real confidence through coding</p> <p>It\\'s like <strong>NotebookLM</strong> but designed to turn YouTube binge-watching into real learning.</p> <p>Try it yourself: Here\\'s a demo video showing it in action: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msM2Nej8m_M\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msM2Nej8m_M</a></p> <p>(First time making videos - used ElevenLabs for AI voiceover since I didn\\'t have proper audio setup, so ignore any watermarks!)</p> <p>You can run it locally with Docker:</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Imhari14/Haash-LM\">https://github.com/Imhari14/Haash-LM</a></p> <p>Docker Hub: <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/imhari14/haash-lm/tags\">https://hub.docker.com/r/imhari14/haash-lm/tags</a></p> <p>I have a bigger vision for this space and want to turn this into a real product.

That\\'s like 4-5 app switches minimum, and by the time i was back, the conversation moved on.</p> <p>My solution i came up with - a floating productivity companion that stays accessible but gets out of the way when not needed. I am calling it Berri and here is what Berri does:</p> <ul> <li>Smart floating interface - appears as a tiny pill on your screen, expands when you hover.

No data collection</li> <li>Global shortcuts - all the tools you need at your fingertips</li> </ul> <p>I\\'m thinking of launching it soon and thought I\\'d garner some reviews before that.

Over the past 3 years, it acquired 63k monthly active users, and has a 4.9 rating.</p> <p>Never made money from it though! After many failed apps, it just makes me happy to see people using something I built.</p> <p>Like many of you, I love building and hate marketing. So, in solidarity, here’s what I learned about user acquisition.</p> <h1>1. Competitors running ads</h1> <p>Yep, this is where I got most of my users. Luck! The #1 swipe photo deleting app ran a TikTok campaign, had a video go viral, and one of the top comments was &quot;Not free. Download &lt;my\\\\_app&gt; instead&quot;. 1000+ downloads in 1 day.</p> <p>This helped my ASO too, because now my app ranks #2 when searching for the competitor app.</p> <h1>2. ASO for niche keywords</h1> <p>3 years ago, I noticed searching &quot;delete photos&quot; didn\\'t return many photo deleting apps. So I added &quot;&lt;my\\\\_app&gt; - Delete Photos&quot;. My app ranked top 20 for &quot;delete photos&quot; for a while, and got 1-2 downloads per day.</p> <h1>3. ASO stickiness</h1> <p>After a year of giving up, I started to actually rank higher for &quot;delete photos&quot; (top 5). So in an attempt to get even more users, I changed my title to &quot;&lt;my\\\\_app&gt; - Clean Photos&quot;, a more competitive keyword. After ~1 more year, it now ranks top 5 for &quot;clean photos&quot;.</p> <p>Even after my app\\'s title changed to have &quot;Clean Photos&quot;, I continue to rank top 2 for &quot;delete photos&quot;. Combined with #1 (my app ranking for my competitor app\\'s name), this suggests app store search \\'remembers\\' which apps are relevant for specific keywords, even if the strings change. </p> <p>So changing your app\\'s title every few months to rank higher for specific keywords might be a good strategy.</p> <h1>4. Keywords</h1> <p>Updating the keywords in App Store Connect never up-ranked my app for any of the listed keywords. No idea how Apple uses this list.</p> <p>The title of the app is the only thing that\\'s changed my app\\'s ranking. And even the title doesn\\'t reliably change it (I currently have &quot;Photo Cleaner&quot; in the title, and it ranks anywhere from 30 to 50th, without pattern).</p> <h1>5. Facebook ads</h1> <p>Spent $500. None of these converted (the downloads graph barely changed). My creative probably sucked though. Best part was finally deleting the Facebook SDK to reduce binary size by 2MB.</p> <h1>6. Google ads</h1> <p>Same here. I spent $100. Nothing noticeable. Creative probably sucked again. Also don’t know how targeting works, so just targeted all iOS users.</p> <h1>7. Ads do work though..</h1> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jack-rogers-b8677655_june-was-our-best-month-ever-at-picnic-activity-7346535909854523393-2JDV\">competitor</a> spends over $3M in ads every year and recently became profitable. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/gen-z-photos-app-swipewipe-sells-to-french-publisher-mwm-in-its-largest-acquisition-to-date/\">Another competitor</a> went viral from a TikTok campaign, and eventually got acquired. </p> <h1>8. Media outlet</h1> <p>A French website wrote an <a href=\"https://www.competencemac.com/iOS-Slider-une-application-pour-supprimer-plus-rapidement-vos-photos_a3834.html\">article</a> about my app. 15 downloads from this web referrer. Thanks Christophe Schmitt!</p> <h1>9. Product Hunt</h1> <p>I <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/vacuum\">posted</a> on PH when I first launched. 5 downloads.</p> <h1>10. Forcing Users to Share the App</h1> <p>In a bold update, after 150 swipes, I forced users to share the app with ONE friend to continue. Once shared, the forced alert would not show up again. Even this tiny ask resulted in over a dozen 1 star ratings. Downloads did not noticeably go up, so I reverted the change.</p> <h1>11. Fixing crashes</h1> <p>I had a 5% crash rate for about 1 week (oops!). I also fixed every other crash in the app later (0.5% -&gt; 5% -&gt; 0% crash rate). Somehow this didn\\'t affect downloads at all, even during the 5% crash rate period.</p> <h1>12. App preview images</h1> <p>I know these are supposed to be important. But even after changing my simple 1 horizontal picture image to 3 vertical images, downloads did not change.</p> <h1>13. In-App Events</h1> <p>Apple has this thing called In-App Events. A big preview image of the event appears in the app store when it\\'s live. I tried one running an In-App Event for ~2 weeks about a new feature I built. Downloads did not change. Usage did not go up.</p> <h1>14. Translations</h1> <p>I spent a day translating the entire app into 9 languages. Did not noticeably increase downloads.</p> <h1>Conclusions</h1> <ul> <li>Marketing trumps all. My competitors run effective ads on TikTok and IG. Their ratings are lower and filled with &quot;ads&quot;, “predatory pricing”, “money grab scam” reviews. But… they rank higher and are profitable.</li> <li>Photo cleanup is a very competitive niche. 5 of the top 50 &quot;Utilities&quot; apps help people delete photos.</li> <li>Building a quality product helps with word-of-mouth marketing. The TikTok comment translating into 1000+ downloads is a good example.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DevelopmentSad4798\"> /u/DevelopmentSad4798 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myb1w1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1myb1w1/3_years_63k_mau_900_profit/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>'}]",

Turns out… it can!</p> <p><strong>What I built:</strong><br /> Limepolicy is a <strong>privacy policy generator</strong> that gives you a full policy in just a few clicks. I built it out of frustration: most existing tools hide necessary sections behind massive paywalls (some go over $200 once you add GDPR, AdSense, analytics, etc.). On the flip side, using ChatGPT to draft policies felt repetitive and boring. So I made something simple:</p> <ul> <li>$2 flat price</li> <li>No tiers, no upsells</li> <li>Full policy including GDPR, AdSense, analytics, etc.</li> </ul> <p>If anyone needs to try 👉 <a href=\"https://www.limepolicy.com/\">https://www.limepolicy.com/</a></p> <p><strong>Journey so far:</strong></p> <ul> <li>~100 users when it was free</li> <li>3 paid users since adding the $2 price (about 1 user a day)</li> <li>Learned a ton, especially around <strong>payments integration</strong> and how real users react to pricing</li> </ul> <p>This is just the start — I’m more excited about what’s ahead than the $2 itself. Balancing product building with a full-time job/studies is tough, but if you enjoy the ride, it’s totally worth it.</p> <p>To everyone building (or thinking of starting): <strong>don’t give up. Just start, stay consistent, and move forward slowly.</strong> You’ll learn way more by shipping something than by waiting for the perfect idea.</p> <p>I’m also planning to start a small community in the future where I’ll share more about what I’ve learned as a full-time software engineer trying to build products on the side.</p> <p>Would love your feedback, critiques, or even brutal honesty.</p> <p>Thanks for reading 🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scoutlabs\"> /u/scoutlabs </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxqc45\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mxqc45/my_first_saas_just_earned_its_first_dollar/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>'}]",

But I decided to share a few more thoughts, like in linked post ;) You don’t have to read everything now; you can skip straight to the website. Not sure what SoundCloud is, or why someone would need a full tracklist? Share it with your DJ friends.</p> <p>If you’re not familiar with the scene, this is a common need among people who listen to full DJ sets. They’re often searching for what was played, which is why SoundCloud comments are full of “ID?” or why people hope someone will upload a tracklist to 1001tracklists. To solve this, I built set79:<br /> * Fully automatic (just post a SoundCloud link)<br /> * Fast, around 30 minutes per set<br /> * Accurate — not perfect, but reliably good<br /> * Generous freemium: analyze as many sets as you want (short queue for free users)<br /> * Simple UX: no signup needed, and you can listen to the set alongside the recognized tracklist in the in-app player </p> <p>I built it out of a real need, and it brings together two things I love: the rave world and programming. That’s why, when people ask me if it’s hard to make yourself sit down and work without a team, I tell them it’s not a problem at all: I’m doing what I love - programming, building my own product, in a domain I truly love. That alone is enough to fill me with motivation and drive. It’s not fake enthusiasm; it’s genuinely easy to wake up in the morning and start working.</p> <p>You might wonder what technical challenges there are in such a web tool. Well, there are many: a lot of engineering to make it run so fast, I had to learn audio fingerprinting from scratch to build a novel algorithm, I’m using state-of-the-art Audio Transformer architectures to detect song transitions, and more.</p> <p>So yes, there’s a lot of technology in such a system, and real coding challenges (the kind Claude or Cursor can’t solve). But as a solo entrepreneur with limited resources, who can only focus on one thing at a time, is opening the IDE to write more code always the most important task? When I look at where I invest my resources, the answer is clear: tech takes the top spot, while marketing, social media, user outreach, and everything else fall behind. I always seem to default to pulling from the tech pile, even though there are heaps of tasks waiting in sales, marketing, or operations. That’s something every indie hacker needs to keep in mind: also other parts of the startup need to be functioning, not just the ones that feel comfortable specifically for you..</p> <p>I have a vision for what this tool can become for producers and DJs. Some ideas are small features on the website that would help them “travel” between sets more easily, like better search tools. Others are bigger steps that could push the app into new capabilities, helping DJs explore fresh music and find inspiration for their sets. On top of that, I already have a large collection of annotated data, which opens opportunities ranging from improving accuracy to experimenting with more advanced AI ideas. But as I said earlier, now it’s time to bring it to a wider audience and invest more in marketing.</p> <p>That’s it. It’s been fun to share different angles of my work: about set79 itself, why I built it, the indie hacker journey, technical challenges, product thoughts, and more. There’s much more behind each of these, but I had to stop somewhere. I’m happy to continue the conversation, so feel free to dive into any of these topics here in the comments.</p> <p>Try it: set79[.]com</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Technical-Bag8507\"> /u/Technical-Bag8507 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/uee06h38mskf1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1my5fei/new_tool_automatic_fast_tracklist_extractor_for/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>'}]",

My name’s Rob &amp; I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts.</p> <p>A couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day.</p> <p>I started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently.</p> <p>First off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS &quot;guru&quot; preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different.</p> <p><strong>My secrets to a successful launch day:</strong></p> <p><strong>Building in “Stealth”:</strong> I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready.</p> <ul> <li>Posted screenshots asking &quot;who wants to try this?&quot; - no product links</li> <li>DMed interested people to join private beta</li> <li>Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building</li> <li>Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better</li> <li>Built hype so launch day went that much better</li> </ul> <p><strong>Launch Day Momentum:</strong> When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD.</p> <ul> <li>Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials → 50,000 views</li> <li>Screenshot PostHog analytics → 20,000 views</li> <li>Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard → 10,000 views</li> <li>Every win becomes content that drives more wins</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why Photos Matter:</strong> Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples’ attention.</p> <ul> <li>People root for underdogs (probably you)</li> <li>Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era)</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Numbers Game:</strong></p> <ul> <li>70 free trials in 24 hours</li> <li>50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%)</li> <li>200,000+ views on X in 24hrs</li> <li>95% of traffic from organic X posts</li> </ul> <p>Over 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, I’m at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending.</p> <p>Ask me anything about:</p> <ul> <li>Failing 5 times and what I learned</li> <li>Building in &quot;stealth&quot; while still posting publicly</li> <li>Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta</li> <li>Launch day execution</li> <li>Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else</li> </ul> <p>Goal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year.

Its nothing fancy but it keeps everything connected to the original Reddit posts so you dont lose sight of what people actually wanted.</p> <p>Most founders build what they think is cool. I built exactly what Reddit users were already asking for word for word.</p> <p><strong>Finding customers who already want it</strong></p> <p>This is where it gets interesting.

Users have dozens of alternatives for almost any SaaS product you can think of.

    "full_text": "Title: How a logistics company saved $1M/year by switching location APIs\n\n[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': '', 'value': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>During the previous quarter I assisted a logistics company in performing an audit of their location API expenses. The bill was around $1.2M annually just for geocoding and routing APIs. Six weeks later, they\\'d cut that to $180K while improving performance.</p> <p>The following section explains exactly how they did it and the framework we used to evaluate alternatives.</p> <p>The company managed 50,000+ daily deliveries across North America while optimizing 200+ delivery routes daily and tracking 800+ vehicles in real-time and providing ETAs to customers. Their google maps platform usage was extensive: 2M geocoding requests monthly at $10K, 5M directions requests at $25K, 15M distance matrix requests at $75K, and 800K map loads at $3.2K, totaling about $113K per month or $1.36M annually. The real kicker was that usage was growing 15% month-over-month, putting them on track to hit $2M+ by year-end.</p> <p>We developed a weighted scoring matrix to evaluate alternatives in an objective manner. The cost analysis component held 40% importance because it included the current monthly expenses together with projected 12-month expenses based on current growth rates and both the current vendor pricing and new vendor pricing at current volume levels and volume discount tiers. Feature parity got 25% weight, including API endpoint coverage, data quality and accuracy, geographic coverage, and response time SLAs. The integration complexity factor was 20% which included SDK availability and quality, API design consistency, migration effort estimation, and developer experience. The remaining 15% of the assessment focused on business risk through evaluations of vendor financial stability and service reliability and support quality and contract flexibility.</p> <p>The evaluation of six providers led radar to become the top choice with an 8.4/10 overall score. Their cost advantage was undeniable: 90% cheaper than google with a 9/10 cost score. They scored 8/10 on features with strong API coverage and excellent accuracy, 9/10 on integration thanks to simple migration and great developer experience, though only 7/10 on business risk as a newer company. Google scored 6.4/10 overall, dragged down by their 2/10 cost score despite perfect 10/10 features and 9/10 risk scores. Mapbox hit 6.2/10, here maps 6.0/10, azure maps 5.8/10, and tomtom 5.4/10.</p> <p>The cost difference was staggering. Google demanded $5.00 for every 1K geocoding requests but radar offered the service at $0.50 which resulted in a 90% cost reduction that would save $1.08M annually. The radar system delivered geocoding accuracy at the same level as google for north american addresses and it included routing with traffic data and distance matrix capabilities and real-time tracking with geofencing features. The main gaps were limited international coverage, which didn’t matter for their use case, and fewer map styling options, but they used custom maps anyway.</p> <p>We implemented this in three phases.</p> <p>The first phase involved a one-week proof of concept during which we conducted an A/B test to evaluate the geocoding accuracy between google and radar using 1000 known test addresses. The test measured accuracy differences, response times, and consistency across different address formats. The results showed accuracy differences under 2 meters for 94% of addresses and 15% faster average response times and sufficient confidence to proceed.</p> <p>The gradual migration took three weeks using feature flags to roll out radar to increasing percentages of traffic starting at 10%, then 25%, 50%, and finally 100%. Each stage included automated rollback triggers if error rates spiked. We built in fallback logic so if radar failed for any reason, the system automatically used google as backup to maintain service reliability. The system tracked real-time costs while monitoring savings and detecting sudden usage surges and it tracked requests per API endpoint and determined equivalent google costs versus actual radar costs.</p> <p>Six months later, the monthly API costs decreased from $113K to $15K which resulted in an 87% reduction that produced $1.18M in annual savings through a 47,200% return on investment from the four weeks of development work. The system achieved a 15% improvement in average response times while sustaining 99.9% uptime which exceeded google\\'s 99.95% target. There was no measurable accuracy difference for north american addresses. The project delivered both short-term cost benefits and faster engineering velocity because of improved APIs and customers experienced better satisfaction from quicker load times and the company obtained more than $1M for product development.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Great-Difference-562\"> /u/Great-Difference-562 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1myhe3t/how_a_logistics_company_saved_1myear_by_switching/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1myhe3t/how_a_logistics_company_saved_1myear_by_switching/\">[comments]</a></span>'}]",
