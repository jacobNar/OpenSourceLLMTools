{"text": "Our car, which I share with my wife, is new enough that it has Bluetooth to connect to the audio system, steering wheel controls, etc. but old enough that it only allows a single device to be stored in its memory. It's impractical to delete and store a new device every time we swap over between the two of us so our solution has been that my wife has the Bluetooth slot while I have a Bluetooth adapter that transmits to an FM channel that I use when I am driving. This is a suboptimal solution because the audio quality is bad, there is regularly interference from random radio stations on long journeys, and I can't use the steering wheel controls to answer calls, change tracks, etc. What I am looking for is a Bluetooth bridge device. Something that stays connected to the car, and which we both can pair to easily. Something that would relay the audio from our phone to the car and signals from the steering wheel controls to our phones. But it seems like a really niche thing. Do you think it might exist? Looking around I can find plenty of Bluetooth FM transmitter devices, or devices that operate either on TX or RX mode, but nothing that fills this two way passthrough function that I want. I should add that I'm not looking to have both our phones connected at the same time necessarily. Just something that is easy to pair with. It may be that we could find something that we can both connect to and then easily flip between which device is connected to the car, a bit like an HDMI switch. Any ideas?", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "I'm in the UK. I'm looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up. There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they'd be complicated to use - I'd be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I'd forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made. Something like this would be pretty much perfect: https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr# - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there's no \"hidden state\" - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don't have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don't really want next to my bed. (I don't mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don't want a constant noise) I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn't change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want. Something like this https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3 looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote \" It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all \" and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don't have full words on them. I have no idea what \"CD\" means in that context. Another reviewer said \" I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc. \" It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn't be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep. I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there's a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it. Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket.", "target": "negative"}

I know I could use a standard kitchen scale but I find eating off of one to be kind of annoying and if I weigh my food, remove it to eat it and the try and weigh it after the scale has timed out. I know I can also just write all the measurements down but why do extra work when a simpler solution could exist. My picture of this in my mind would be like a plastic bowl shaped shell with a scale in the base of the bowl, with either a screen on the side of the bowl to display weight or an app that can link to it to track the measurements.

{"text": "Hey Community Members, This is a bit personal, but it’s the reason I’m here. Like many of you, I've seen the devastating impact of depression and loneliness on people I care about. That feeling of being alone with your thoughts at 3 AM, with no one to talk to, is something I believe no one should have to endure. The statistics on suicide and mental health are terrifying, and I got tired of feeling helpless. I decided I had to do something . So, I poured everything I had into building ThunDroid . It's an AI mental health companion for iOS. My goal wasn't to replace therapists, but to create a safe, non-judgmental space that's available 24/7. It’s for those moments when you need to talk, vent, or just get out of your own head, but don't have anywhere else to turn. I focused on the things I believe matter most: A Real Conversation: The AI is trained in proven therapeutic methods (CBT, DBT, ACT). It doesn't just give robotic answers; it understands context, adapts to your mood, and learns from you. You can talk to it without any limits. Absolute Privacy: This was non-negotiable for me. All your conversations and journal entries are secured with military-grade encryption and never leave your device . I can't see them, and no one else can either. Your privacy is yours alone. Tools That Actually Work: Beyond the chat, I included things that genuinely help, like a smart journaling system to help you spot patterns in your anxiety, and 13 different professional breathing exercises (including the Navy SEAL Box Breathing technique) for when you feel overwhelmed. I know the idea of an \"AI therapist\" can sound weird, and I want to be crystal clear: ThunDroid is a tool to complement, not replace, professional mental health care. It's a companion for the journey. My mission is to get this into the hands of millions and make a real dent in the suffering caused by mental health struggles. But I can't do it alone. I’m turning to you, the Reddit community, for help. There's a 3-day free trial with full access to everything. I would be incredibly grateful if you would download it, try it out, and give me your honest feedback. Tell me what you love, what you hate, and what's missing. Your insights will be invaluable in helping me improve it for others. My dream is that one day, someone, somewhere, feeling at their absolute lowest, will open this app instead of giving up. If I can achieve that even once, all of this will have been worth it. Thank you for reading. App Store Link: https://apps.apple.com/app/thundroid-ai/id6746182736 TL;DR: I built a highly secure, AI-powered mental health companion app to fight loneliness and depression. It offers unlimited AI chat, smart journaling, and breathing exercises. My mission is to make mental support accessible 24/7.

{"text": "When I was 25 I moved to San Francisco with 2 friends to build a startup. We had no money, no network, no nothing. At one point we were literally sleeping on the floor of a co-working space and waking up before the cleaning staff came in. (Yes… kinda shameful, but also kinda funny looking back). Our tiny accelerator gave us 50k. We stretched it for a year. At the end there was only $2k left in the company account. My cofounder and I met with our mentor and told him: “that’s it, we’re done.” He looked at us and said: “2k is enough for 2 plane tickets back to Europe. Or it’s enough to do something bold. Up to you.” I was 99% sure I was going home. The next day, out of nowhere, a top VC partner tweeted she was looking for “the TikTok of jobs.” That was exactly what we were building. Through a random intro, we got a meeting with her. We went to their office (first time in my life sitting across from people whose names I’d only seen in TechCrunch). The meeting went “meh.” No big fireworks. She gave us a copy of Ben Horowitz’s book and said the classic “we’ll be in touch.” Two days later I’m in an elevator and another VC casually says: “Congrats guys, heard the news.” I’m like… what news?? He smiles: “you’ll see, check your email.” Turns out the big fund had scheduled us for a full partner meeting. Ten partners around the table. We even crossed paths with Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz in the hallway. We pitched. Crickets. Almost no questions. Next day: rejection. But here’s the wild thing: apparently when a huge fund like that meets a tiny unknown startup, every other VC in town finds out instantly. Even though we got a “no,” it created a FOMO wave. Suddenly doors opened everywhere. Within 6 months we raised $1.5M, and a bit later another $6M. Lesson: never give up until the very last minute. The “no” that crushes you today can be the domino that makes others say yes tomorrow. That experience bought me a few extra years in SF until COVID hit and I moved to NY. Fast forward to today: I’m building again. Different space this time. We help businesses get organic traffic for free and rank high on LLMs (think ChatGPT answers). It’s self-serve, B2B, and somehow in less than a year more than 1,000 companies are already using it. Multi-millions in revenue, growing crazy fast. Funny enough, I can now email those same VCs directly, and the convo is completely different. They don’t invest in tools like this anymore (“no defensible moat,” “distribution > product,” etc.). Which I actually kinda agree with… but still ironic after everything. Anyway, just wanted to share because 25-year-old me almost gave up with $2k left and a plane ticket home. Sometimes the biggest turning point comes the day after you think it’s over.", "target": "negative"}
