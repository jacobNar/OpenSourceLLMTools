{"text": "Our car, which I share with my wife, is new enough that it has Bluetooth to connect to the audio system, steering wheel controls, etc. but old enough that it only allows a single device to be stored in its memory. It's impractical to delete and store a new device every time we swap over between the two of us so our solution has been that my wife has the Bluetooth slot while I have a Bluetooth adapter that transmits to an FM channel that I use when I am driving. This is a suboptimal solution because the audio quality is bad, there is regularly interference from random radio stations on long journeys, and I can't use the steering wheel controls to answer calls, change tracks, etc. What I am looking for is a Bluetooth bridge device. Something that stays connected to the car, and which we both can pair to easily. Something that would relay the audio from our phone to the car and signals from the steering wheel controls to our phones. But it seems like a really niche thing. Do you think it might exist? Looking around I can find plenty of Bluetooth FM transmitter devices, or devices that operate either on TX or RX mode, but nothing that fills this two way passthrough function that I want. I should add that I'm not looking to have both our phones connected at the same time necessarily. Just something that is easy to pair with. It may be that we could find something that we can both connect to and then easily flip between which device is connected to the car, a bit like an HDMI switch. Any ideas?", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "I'm in the UK. I'm looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up. There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they'd be complicated to use - I'd be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I'd forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made. Something like this would be pretty much perfect: https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr# - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there's no \"hidden state\" - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don't have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don't really want next to my bed. (I don't mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don't want a constant noise) I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn't change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want. Something like this https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3 looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote \" It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all \" and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don't have full words on them. I have no idea what \"CD\" means in that context. Another reviewer said \" I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc. \" It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn't be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep. I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there's a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it. Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket.", "target": "positive"}

I know I could use a standard kitchen scale but I find eating off of one to be kind of annoying and if I weigh my food, remove it to eat it and the try and weigh it after the scale has timed out. I know I can also just write all the measurements down but why do extra work when a simpler solution could exist. My picture of this in my mind would be like a plastic bowl shaped shell with a scale in the base of the bowl, with either a screen on the side of the bowl to display weight or an app that can link to it to track the measurements.

{"text": "Hey Community Members, This is a bit personal, but its the reason Im here. Like many of you, I've seen the devastating impact of depression and loneliness on people I care about. That feeling of being alone with your thoughts at 3 AM, with no one to talk to, is something I believe no one should have to endure. The statistics on suicide and mental health are terrifying, and I got tired of feeling helpless. I decided I had to do something . So, I poured everything I had into building ThunDroid . It's an AI mental health companion for iOS. My goal wasn't to replace therapists, but to create a safe, non-judgmental space that's available 24/7. Its for those moments when you need to talk, vent, or just get out of your own head, but don't have anywhere else to turn. I focused on the things I believe matter most: A Real Conversation: The AI is trained in proven therapeutic methods (CBT, DBT, ACT). It doesn't just give robotic answers; it understands context, adapts to your mood, and learns from you. You can talk to it without any limits. Absolute Privacy: This was non-negotiable for me. All your conversations and journal entries are secured with military-grade encryption and never leave your device . I can't see them, and no one else can either. Your privacy is yours alone. Tools That Actually Work: Beyond the chat, I included things that genuinely help, like a smart journaling system to help you spot patterns in your anxiety, and 13 different professional breathing exercises (including the Navy SEAL Box Breathing technique) for when you feel overwhelmed. I know the idea of an \"AI therapist\" can sound weird, and I want to be crystal clear: ThunDroid is a tool to complement, not replace, professional mental health care. It's a companion for the journey. My mission is to get this into the hands of millions and make a real dent in the suffering caused by mental health struggles. But I can't do it alone. Im turning to you, the Reddit community, for help. There's a 3-day free trial with full access to everything. I would be incredibly grateful if you would download it, try it out, and give me your honest feedback. Tell me what you love, what you hate, and what's missing. Your insights will be invaluable in helping me improve it for others. My dream is that one day, someone, somewhere, feeling at their absolute lowest, will open this app instead of giving up. If I can achieve that even once, all of this will have been worth it. Thank you for reading. App Store Link: https://apps.apple.com/app/thundroid-ai/id6746182736 TL;DR: I built a highly secure, AI-powered mental health companion app to fight loneliness and depression.

All these numbers and figures are made up, obviously, so... She can't find something like that and in looking in the play store, nothing seems right either. Does anyone know of anything that does that? She'd also like for the chance to change the figure every once in a while. Like \"Oh, you paid $50 more this month?

{"text": "When I was 25 I moved to San Francisco with 2 friends to build a startup. We had no money, no network, no nothing. At one point we were literally sleeping on the floor of a co-working space and waking up before the cleaning staff came in. (Yes kinda shameful, but also kinda funny looking back). Our tiny accelerator gave us 50k. We stretched it for a year. At the end there was only $2k left in the company account. My cofounder and I met with our mentor and told him: thats it, were done. He looked at us and said: 2k is enough for 2 plane tickets back to Europe. Or its enough to do something bold. Up to you. I was 99% sure I was going home. The next day, out of nowhere, a top VC partner tweeted she was looking for the TikTok of jobs. That was exactly what we were building. Through a random intro, we got a meeting with her. We went to their office (first time in my life sitting across from people whose names Id only seen in TechCrunch). The meeting went meh. No big fireworks. She gave us a copy of Ben Horowitzs book and said the classic well be in touch. Two days later Im in an elevator and another VC casually says: Congrats guys, heard the news. Im like what news?? He smiles: youll see, check your email. Turns out the big fund had scheduled us for a full partner meeting. Ten partners around the table. We even crossed paths with Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz in the hallway. We pitched. Crickets. Almost no questions. Next day: rejection. But heres the wild thing: apparently when a huge fund like that meets a tiny unknown startup, every other VC in town finds out instantly. Even though we got a no, it created a FOMO wave. Suddenly doors opened everywhere. Within 6 months we raised $1.5M, and a bit later another $6M. Lesson: never give up until the very last minute. The no that crushes you today can be the domino that makes others say yes tomorrow. That experience bought me a few extra years in SF until COVID hit and I moved to NY. Fast forward to today: Im building again. Different space this time. We help businesses get organic traffic for free and rank high on LLMs (think ChatGPT answers). Its self-serve, B2B, and somehow in less than a year more than 1,000 companies are already using it. Multi-millions in revenue, growing crazy fast. Funny enough, I can now email those same VCs directly, and the convo is completely different. They dont invest in tools like this anymore (no defensible moat, distribution > product, etc.). Which I actually kinda agree with but still ironic after everything. Anyway, just wanted to share because 25-year-old me almost gave up with $2k left and a plane ticket home. Sometimes the biggest turning point comes the day after you think its over.", "target": "negative"}

{"text": "I don't know how well you remember how you felt when you discovered the internet for the first time. Or when you got your first smartphone and went to the app store to download a hundred different apps and games. Or how it felt when you found something online that was niche but beautiful and meaningful to you. Something that felt personal. Something that forged a connection with you. I've felt a lack of this emotion / feeling of novelty / discovery over time. As the internet became more larger, commodified, and corporatised, these tiny, personal corners of the internet slowly disappeared in obscurity. Eclipsed, so to speak. It's a problem of scale. Of algorithms. How do you penetrate deep into the internet to find something niche anymore when your only gateways are search engines and algorithms that promote only the most visited and popular places first? \"Relevance\" they call it. But what's relevant to you? So there was this one problem as mentioned above, and there were other problems too. The problem of privacy. The problem of pinterest going down the drain. Banning users en masse. Around the time all this was happening, we also experienced, with dismay, the failure of the game \"No man's sky\" which promised to help recapture this familar feeling of discovery / novelty. What went wrong there? I thought hard about all of this. I formulated some hypotheses of how a search engine can be used to facilitate the discovery of something truly novel and niche and interesting and beautiful. I mean it has to be through a search engine after all. Those are the ultimate gateways to the internet. And et voil! Something clicked. The following were my observations: - whatever it was had to have a huge aspect of randomneess associated with it - it had to be related to images, not words - it had to be recursive. Like entering rabbit holes. You should be able to \"go deeper\" into any given niche. That is how Photo Pilot was born. It's not so much an app but a tool with a variety of different applications. This is how it works: It samples a random set of images from the internet. Each image leads to more images. And so on. This is how it's meant to be used: - A user executes a random search and recieves a sampling of images from the internet. - Images that evoke interest or imply a presence of something interesting on the source web page are \"collected\". After being collected they can be tagged and organised and users can visit the source webpage. - Then, these images can be clicked on to receive a new set of images that go \"deeper\" into a given niche. - Repeat The results have been stunning. Yes, there is a learning curve. But there's also a lot of potential. There's so much development that can be done based on this one concept. So far I'm glad to report 1.3k users on Google Play alone. The ios app store also has around half that amount of downloads. I've made the app in a way that respects all users' privacy. There are no user accounts or analytics. Everything is stored on an offline sqlite database. I'd love it if some of you can try it and provide some feedback. Like I said, there is a learning curve so I'll be here for support. Thoughts? :) And thank you for your time!", "target": ""}

{"text": "I'm consulting for a small business on some operations things and he hired a \"fractional CMO\" who is providing services. As best I can tell, this CMO doesn't have any contracted deliverables, and describes herself as doing \"high-level strategy\" related to marketing. (I don't know what differentiates high-level strategy from low-level strategy.) Here's the problem: I think this fractional might be full of shit. As best I can tell, she's just feeding prompts into some ChatGPT-type platform and uncritically serving up the results. I'm not a marketer, but I've worked on enough marketing projects to tell good work from bad, and this is bad . The brand strategy is generic and indistinguishable from our direct competition; the audience segmentation isn't based on any data; there are dozens of untracked marketing performance metrics that are never discussed in leadership meetings. Just today, our agency emailed her (and CC'd me for reasons) with a simple question, and she gave two wrong answers before she gave the right one - all of which were clearly generated by a chatbot. On top of it all, she recommended and hired an agency to rebuild the company website, but without doing any prior work on audience, product, brand, or conversion strategy. It was an enormous investment and the output has been exceptional only in its mediocrity. I've noticed this really obvious deficiency, but she papers over it with a deluge of ChatGPT-generated reports, analysis, and summaries. I think she's taking the client for a ride (and charges a lot for it). How would you approach flagging this for the client without creating animosity or conflict? If the client ultimately doesn't decide to terminate this fractional, I don't want to be left having to navigate an adversarial relationship for the rest of my contract.

{"text": "When I first added embroidery to my store, I treated it like a side quest. You know, Throw a logo on a cap and see what happens. I wasnt ready for it to actually outsell some of my printed stuff. Embroidery has this built-in premium feel you just cant fake. People will happily pay more for something that feels like itll survive the washing machine for years instead of cracking or fading. Even the simplest designs, a letter, a small icon, somehow feel more intentional when theyre stitched. But heres the part nobody warned me about: Production costs are higher, and you cant always pass the entire bump to customers without making them flinch. Digitization fees are the silent killer. My first month, I ordered 7 new designs through different suppliers and didnt even notice I was paying $10$15 each just to turn them into stitch files. By the end of the month, Id spent more on setup than the products themselves. Design limitations are real. Fine details that look gorgeous in print often turn into a fuzzy blob in embroidery. Gradients? Just no. Skipping samples , my rookie mistake. I once launched a hoodie with a super detailed mandala embroidery from a supplier Id never tested. On the mockup it looked stunning. The real version? It looked like someone sneezed mid-stitch. Now Im a lot more strategic: Keep embroidery for bold, simple designs, chunky text, initials, clean logos. Stick with printing for anything detailed or full-color where I want the art preserved exactly. Batch my digitization work to avoid paying fees every other week. And heres a tip from my trial-and-error phase: order from a couple of different POD companies before you commit. I grabbed samples from Printify, Apliiq, and Printful, lined them up on my desk, and compared stitching quality, thread colors, and fabric feel. The differences were bigger than I expected, and it made it clear which ones Id actually trust for customer orders. If youre thinking about offering both embroidery and printing, Id say go for it, but start small. Test a couple of embroidery pieces next to your printed ones and see how your audience reacts. For me, embroidery went from nice extra to one of my best upsells.", "target": "negative"}
