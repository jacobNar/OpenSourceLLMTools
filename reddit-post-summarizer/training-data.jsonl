{"text": "Our car, which I share with my wife, is new enough that it has Bluetooth to connect to the audio system, steering wheel controls, etc. but old enough that it only allows a single device to be stored in its memory. It's impractical to delete and store a new device every time we swap over between the two of us so our solution has been that my wife has the Bluetooth slot while I have a Bluetooth adapter that transmits to an FM channel that I use when I am driving. This is a suboptimal solution because the audio quality is bad, there is regularly interference from random radio stations on long journeys, and I can't use the steering wheel controls to answer calls, change tracks, etc. What I am looking for is a Bluetooth bridge device. Something that stays connected to the car, and which we both can pair to easily. Something that would relay the audio from our phone to the car and signals from the steering wheel controls to our phones. But it seems like a really niche thing. Do you think it might exist? Looking around I can find plenty of Bluetooth FM transmitter devices, or devices that operate either on TX or RX mode, but nothing that fills this two way passthrough function that I want. I should add that I'm not looking to have both our phones connected at the same time necessarily. Just something that is easy to pair with. It may be that we could find something that we can both connect to and then easily flip between which device is connected to the car, a bit like an HDMI switch. Any ideas?", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "I'm in the UK. I'm looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up. There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they'd be complicated to use - I'd be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I'd forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made. Something like this would be pretty much perfect: https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr# - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there's no \"hidden state\" - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don't have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don't really want next to my bed. (I don't mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don't want a constant noise) I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn't change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want. Something like this https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3 looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote \" It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all \" and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don't have full words on them. I have no idea what \"CD\" means in that context. Another reviewer said \" I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc. \" It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn't be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep. I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there's a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it. Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket.", "target": "positive"}

I know I could use a standard kitchen scale but I find eating off of one to be kind of annoying and if I weigh my food, remove it to eat it and the try and weigh it after the scale has timed out. I know I can also just write all the measurements down but why do extra work when a simpler solution could exist. My picture of this in my mind would be like a plastic bowl shaped shell with a scale in the base of the bowl, with either a screen on the side of the bowl to display weight or an app that can link to it to track the measurements.

{"text": "Hey Community Members, This is a bit personal, but its the reason Im here. Like many of you, I've seen the devastating impact of depression and loneliness on people I care about. That feeling of being alone with your thoughts at 3 AM, with no one to talk to, is something I believe no one should have to endure. The statistics on suicide and mental health are terrifying, and I got tired of feeling helpless. I decided I had to do something . So, I poured everything I had into building ThunDroid . It's an AI mental health companion for iOS. My goal wasn't to replace therapists, but to create a safe, non-judgmental space that's available 24/7. Its for those moments when you need to talk, vent, or just get out of your own head, but don't have anywhere else to turn. I focused on the things I believe matter most: A Real Conversation: The AI is trained in proven therapeutic methods (CBT, DBT, ACT). It doesn't just give robotic answers; it understands context, adapts to your mood, and learns from you. You can talk to it without any limits. Absolute Privacy: This was non-negotiable for me. All your conversations and journal entries are secured with military-grade encryption and never leave your device . I can't see them, and no one else can either. Your privacy is yours alone. Tools That Actually Work: Beyond the chat, I included things that genuinely help, like a smart journaling system to help you spot patterns in your anxiety, and 13 different professional breathing exercises (including the Navy SEAL Box Breathing technique) for when you feel overwhelmed. I know the idea of an \"AI therapist\" can sound weird, and I want to be crystal clear: ThunDroid is a tool to complement, not replace, professional mental health care. It's a companion for the journey. My mission is to get this into the hands of millions and make a real dent in the suffering caused by mental health struggles. But I can't do it alone. Im turning to you, the Reddit community, for help. There's a 3-day free trial with full access to everything. I would be incredibly grateful if you would download it, try it out, and give me your honest feedback. Tell me what you love, what you hate, and what's missing. Your insights will be invaluable in helping me improve it for others. My dream is that one day, someone, somewhere, feeling at their absolute lowest, will open this app instead of giving up. If I can achieve that even once, all of this will have been worth it. Thank you for reading. App Store Link: https://apps.apple.com/app/thundroid-ai/id6746182736 TL;DR: I built a highly secure, AI-powered mental health companion app to fight loneliness and depression.

She is looking for an app that will allow you to input you original mortage amount, the interest, the min monthly payment, the remaining amount, and then what you actually pay and it will countdown to your final payment.

All these numbers and figures are made up, obviously, so... She can't find something like that and in looking in the play store, nothing seems right either. Does anyone know of anything that does that? She'd also like for the chance to change the figure every once in a while. Like \"Oh, you paid $50 more this month?

{"text": "When I was 25 I moved to San Francisco with 2 friends to build a startup. We had no money, no network, no nothing. At one point we were literally sleeping on the floor of a co-working space and waking up before the cleaning staff came in. (Yes kinda shameful, but also kinda funny looking back). Our tiny accelerator gave us 50k. We stretched it for a year. At the end there was only $2k left in the company account. My cofounder and I met with our mentor and told him: thats it, were done. He looked at us and said: 2k is enough for 2 plane tickets back to Europe. Or its enough to do something bold. Up to you. I was 99% sure I was going home. The next day, out of nowhere, a top VC partner tweeted she was looking for the TikTok of jobs. That was exactly what we were building. Through a random intro, we got a meeting with her. We went to their office (first time in my life sitting across from people whose names Id only seen in TechCrunch). The meeting went meh. No big fireworks. She gave us a copy of Ben Horowitzs book and said the classic well be in touch. Two days later Im in an elevator and another VC casually says: Congrats guys, heard the news. Im like what news?? He smiles: youll see, check your email. Turns out the big fund had scheduled us for a full partner meeting. Ten partners around the table. We even crossed paths with Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz in the hallway. We pitched. Crickets. Almost no questions. Next day: rejection. But heres the wild thing: apparently when a huge fund like that meets a tiny unknown startup, every other VC in town finds out instantly. Even though we got a no, it created a FOMO wave. Suddenly doors opened everywhere. Within 6 months we raised $1.5M, and a bit later another $6M. Lesson: never give up until the very last minute. The no that crushes you today can be the domino that makes others say yes tomorrow. That experience bought me a few extra years in SF until COVID hit and I moved to NY. Fast forward to today: Im building again. Different space this time. We help businesses get organic traffic for free and rank high on LLMs (think ChatGPT answers). Its self-serve, B2B, and somehow in less than a year more than 1,000 companies are already using it. Multi-millions in revenue, growing crazy fast. Funny enough, I can now email those same VCs directly, and the convo is completely different. They dont invest in tools like this anymore (no defensible moat, distribution > product, etc.). Which I actually kinda agree with but still ironic after everything. Anyway, just wanted to share because 25-year-old me almost gave up with $2k left and a plane ticket home. Sometimes the biggest turning point comes the day after you think its over.", "target": "negative"}

{"text": "I don't know how well you remember how you felt when you discovered the internet for the first time. Or when you got your first smartphone and went to the app store to download a hundred different apps and games. Or how it felt when you found something online that was niche but beautiful and meaningful to you. Something that felt personal. Something that forged a connection with you. I've felt a lack of this emotion / feeling of novelty / discovery over time. As the internet became more larger, commodified, and corporatised, these tiny, personal corners of the internet slowly disappeared in obscurity. Eclipsed, so to speak. It's a problem of scale. Of algorithms. How do you penetrate deep into the internet to find something niche anymore when your only gateways are search engines and algorithms that promote only the most visited and popular places first? \"Relevance\" they call it. But what's relevant to you? So there was this one problem as mentioned above, and there were other problems too. The problem of privacy. The problem of pinterest going down the drain. Banning users en masse. Around the time all this was happening, we also experienced, with dismay, the failure of the game \"No man's sky\" which promised to help recapture this familar feeling of discovery / novelty. What went wrong there? I thought hard about all of this. I formulated some hypotheses of how a search engine can be used to facilitate the discovery of something truly novel and niche and interesting and beautiful. I mean it has to be through a search engine after all. Those are the ultimate gateways to the internet. And et voil! Something clicked. The following were my observations: - whatever it was had to have a huge aspect of randomneess associated with it - it had to be related to images, not words - it had to be recursive. Like entering rabbit holes. You should be able to \"go deeper\" into any given niche. That is how Photo Pilot was born. It's not so much an app but a tool with a variety of different applications. This is how it works: It samples a random set of images from the internet. Each image leads to more images. And so on. This is how it's meant to be used: - A user executes a random search and recieves a sampling of images from the internet. - Images that evoke interest or imply a presence of something interesting on the source web page are \"collected\". After being collected they can be tagged and organised and users can visit the source webpage. - Then, these images can be clicked on to receive a new set of images that go \"deeper\" into a given niche. - Repeat The results have been stunning. Yes, there is a learning curve. But there's also a lot of potential. There's so much development that can be done based on this one concept. So far I'm glad to report 1.3k users on Google Play alone. The ios app store also has around half that amount of downloads. I've made the app in a way that respects all users' privacy. There are no user accounts or analytics. Everything is stored on an offline sqlite database. I'd love it if some of you can try it and provide some feedback. Like I said, there is a learning curve so I'll be here for support. Thoughts? :) And thank you for your time!", "target": "negative"}

{"text": "I'm consulting for a small business on some operations things and he hired a \"fractional CMO\" who is providing services. As best I can tell, this CMO doesn't have any contracted deliverables, and describes herself as doing \"high-level strategy\" related to marketing. (I don't know what differentiates high-level strategy from low-level strategy.) Here's the problem: I think this fractional might be full of shit. As best I can tell, she's just feeding prompts into some ChatGPT-type platform and uncritically serving up the results. I'm not a marketer, but I've worked on enough marketing projects to tell good work from bad, and this is bad . The brand strategy is generic and indistinguishable from our direct competition; the audience segmentation isn't based on any data; there are dozens of untracked marketing performance metrics that are never discussed in leadership meetings. Just today, our agency emailed her (and CC'd me for reasons) with a simple question, and she gave two wrong answers before she gave the right one - all of which were clearly generated by a chatbot. On top of it all, she recommended and hired an agency to rebuild the company website, but without doing any prior work on audience, product, brand, or conversion strategy. It was an enormous investment and the output has been exceptional only in its mediocrity. I've noticed this really obvious deficiency, but she papers over it with a deluge of ChatGPT-generated reports, analysis, and summaries. I think she's taking the client for a ride (and charges a lot for it). How would you approach flagging this for the client without creating animosity or conflict? If the client ultimately doesn't decide to terminate this fractional, I don't want to be left having to navigate an adversarial relationship for the rest of my contract.

{"text": "When I first added embroidery to my store, I treated it like a side quest. You know, Throw a logo on a cap and see what happens. I wasnt ready for it to actually outsell some of my printed stuff. Embroidery has this built-in premium feel you just cant fake. People will happily pay more for something that feels like itll survive the washing machine for years instead of cracking or fading. Even the simplest designs, a letter, a small icon, somehow feel more intentional when theyre stitched. But heres the part nobody warned me about: Production costs are higher, and you cant always pass the entire bump to customers without making them flinch. Digitization fees are the silent killer. My first month, I ordered 7 new designs through different suppliers and didnt even notice I was paying $10$15 each just to turn them into stitch files. By the end of the month, Id spent more on setup than the products themselves. Design limitations are real. Fine details that look gorgeous in print often turn into a fuzzy blob in embroidery. Gradients? Just no. Skipping samples , my rookie mistake. I once launched a hoodie with a super detailed mandala embroidery from a supplier Id never tested. On the mockup it looked stunning. The real version? It looked like someone sneezed mid-stitch. Now Im a lot more strategic: Keep embroidery for bold, simple designs, chunky text, initials, clean logos. Stick with printing for anything detailed or full-color where I want the art preserved exactly. Batch my digitization work to avoid paying fees every other week. And heres a tip from my trial-and-error phase: order from a couple of different POD companies before you commit. I grabbed samples from Printify, Apliiq, and Printful, lined them up on my desk, and compared stitching quality, thread colors, and fabric feel. The differences were bigger than I expected, and it made it clear which ones Id actually trust for customer orders. If youre thinking about offering both embroidery and printing, Id say go for it, but start small. Test a couple of embroidery pieces next to your printed ones and see how your audience reacts. For me, embroidery went from nice extra to one of my best upsells.", "target": "negative"}

You snap a photo, or upload an image, and the AI detects the events and adds them into your calendar, a real time saver for those who use the calendar a lot but still have many stuff written on paper or screenshots.I launched the app with 3 revenue streams, ads on generation, a lifetime subscription at discounted price, and a super cheap monthly plan.I did some marketing here on reddit and got mostly 3 types of comments,positive feedback from normal users who liked the ideasolid feedback from tech ppl who gave me advices on landing, pricing and featuresfeedback from frustrated users who, since they can’t build something ppl want, spend their time here calling others scammers. but here is the truth, and tell me what you think, I’m ready for a rain of shit if needed.The biggest critic I got was that the lifetime subscription price is too low to be sustainable, so I must be a scammer who wants to cash quick and then abandon the app. maybe, and I say it with a bit of arrogance, I’m just someone who knows how to do the math and define strategies, I prefer to share them here rather than being called scammer, so here it is,the problem my app solves will be integrated on device by android and ios very soon, ios already does it with apple intelligence on iphone 16, so what I’m selling as lifetime is actually more like 2 years max, it’s not a scam it’s just understanding the market and betting on timingthe average free user watches ads, turns out that the average revenue of a video ad on my app is about 30x the cost of a generation, this means one free user can pay for around 30 subscribed users, so if math is not lying, keeping 1/30 paying conversion rate makes the app sustainable and subs are just pure extraif point 2 fails, cpm not stable, higher conversions, uneven usage, I have fallback, the price of one lifetime sub covers about 400 generations, even if a user would generate once every day (stats say less), that would cover more than a year and ads would cover the restI don’t think I’ll be rich with this app, probably make some hundreds or maybe just break even, but I’m tired of being called scammer by ppl who don’t understand the strategy, so now you know everything, reddit heroes, what do you think?Happy to hear feedback, constructive critics and opinions on this plan.", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "10 years ago, I was 25 and convinced I’d be a millionaire by 30.I consumed all the “hustle” content Gary V, Grant Cardone, you name it. My diet was coffee, podcasts, and self-loathing.I started a small e-commerce store with literally $1,200 scraped from my savings. The first year was brutal: 80+ hour weeks, no vacations, constant stress. But it worked. By year 3, revenue hit $1.2M. On paper, I was “living the dream”.Here’s the catch:I didn’t see my friends for months.I was 40 pounds overweight.I once missed my mom’s birthday dinner because I was negotiating a $3,000 wholesale deal (that later fell through).My relationship ended because I was married to Shopify, not her.Financial breakdown (for the curious):Year 1: $36k revenue / $12k profitYear 2: $400k revenue / $85k profitYear 3: $1.2M revenue / $210k profitYear 4: $850k revenue / $120k profit (market shift + burnout = decline)What’s wild is that when I finally “made it” (six figures profit), I felt worse than when I was broke.I had money, but no life.The turning point was honestly embarrassing: I ended up in the ER at 29 with heart palpitations from stress + caffeine. The doctor literally said: “Your business is killing you faster than poverty would.”So I pulled back.Hired a real team instead of trying to be Superman.Sold off part of the company.Built slower, but more sustainably.Now I’m 35. Net worth is ~$2.4M (mix of business equity, real estate, and cash), but the real win is that I sleep 8 hours a night, spend time with my kid, and don’t check Slack at 3am anymore.Lessons I wish someone had drilled into me earlier:Revenue ≠ happiness.Profit ≠ freedom (if you’re chained to the business).“Grinding” works, but it also grinds you.Hire sooner than you think.Family and health compound faster than money.I’m sharing this because I see a lot of people here asking for the “magic pill” or obsessing over hitting $1M. I was that guy. The million is great, but if you don’t design your life first, you’ll hate the life you sacrificed everything for.Question to the sub: For those of you who “made it” (whatever that means for you) did it actually feel like you expected? Or did you have to re-define success too?", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "8 months ago, I launched a database that analyzes real user problems from multiple sources to help founders find their next profitable SaaS idea. It's basically been my obsession for months, and it's actually working.A few months back, I came across this (now deleted) post about someone who worked at a hotel and noticed a flaw in the hotel's software. They ended up building a plugin to fix it... and made a nice side income from it. That got me thinking: How many other overlooked software problems are lurking out there, waiting for a solution?I wanted to help entrepreneurs skip the guesswork entirely. If users are complaining about something enough to leave negative reviews, there's likely a market for a better solution.Here's what I built: I analyzed over 150k negative G2 reviews from 8k+ companies, 50k negative App Store reviews from 5k+ mobile apps across 160 keywords, and scraped thousands of Reddit threads where people actively complain about existing tools and missing features.For G2, I used AI to find specific user problems with existing software that could be turned into full competitors or lightweight alternatives.For the App Store, I analyzed reviews across categories like period trackers, meal planners, photo editors, and travel apps to identify what users hate about current solutions.Everything is organized by category and company so you can drill down into specific issues users have with certain tools, or scan real problems across entire industries. You're literally searching through validated problems that people are already paying to solve.For Reddit, I found threads where users are actively discussing broken workflows and feature gaps in popular tools.The results so far:-20,000 people visited the site-1,500 signed up-60 paid customers-$4,000 earned in just these 2 months-$20,000 total since launchNot life changing money yet, but it feels incredible. It's proof that people will actually pay for something I built if I provide real value. It's been tough watching other projects blow up while mine grew slowly (really slowly). I failed flat on my face 8 times before this. But I've learned that consistency absolutely beats going viral once and getting lucky. To anyone building something and feeling invisible: keep iterating. Keep solving real problems. The data doesn't lie - if thousands of users are complaining about the same issues, there's an opportunity there. If you're building or improving a SaaS, this system might save you tons of market research and potentially give you the last product idea you'll ever need. Keep buildingHere’s the link if you want to check it out: BigIdeasDBand here’s the proof (since its reddit lol): Proof", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "I’ve been a lurker here for years, and I finally have a story to tell.A bit about me: I'm 35, and for the last decade, I've had a comfortable career as a Senior SWE at one of the Top 5 tech companies. The pay is great, the work is challenging, and I'm grateful for it. Like many of you, the idea of building my own SaaS has been a persistent daydream for ages, but it never went beyond notes and domain name registrations.That changed about two years ago. My dad lost his job, and my parents, who are incredibly proud people, started to struggle financially. I was in a position to help them with my salary, and I did, but I could tell it wasn't a long-term solution they'd ever be comfortable with. They needed purpose and independence, not a handout from their son.So, I had a different idea. I decided to start an e-commerce business for them centered around custom home decor. I bought a simple machine, set up a website, and taught them the ropes. To my amazement, it took off. What started on a workbench in their garage has now scaled to a small 150m2 factory with 4 employees. Both my mom and dad work there, and my brother recently joined them. It generates a real, decent monthly salary for them, and I don't take a penny. Watching their stress melt away and be replaced by the pride of building something has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.But here's the part for this sub: Building that e-commerce business was HARD. As a software engineer, I was naive about the sheer number of non-technical obstacles. I wrestled with everything from clunky inventory management and supply chain logistics to inefficient marketing automation and customer service workflows. I found myself constantly saying, \"There has to be a better way to do this.\" I was stitching together five different tools, writing custom scripts, and still felt like I was operating with one hand tied behind my back. These pain points became my obsession. A few months ago, I started working on a SaaS to solve the very problems I faced.And this is where things get wild. AI has completely changed the game. I'm still at my full-time job, so this is a side project. Yet, my development velocity is unlike anything I've ever experienced. With the help of AI tools for code generation, architecture planning, and debugging, I'm not just building faster. I'm building smarter. I'm on track to have a V1 of my product ready in about 6 months. This isn't just a simple tool. I'm building a platform with a core feature set and level of sophistication that I see in established, public companies valued in the $5B - $8B range.It sounds insane for a solo dev on a side project to even say that, but that's the seismic shift that's happening. The barrier to entry for building complex, powerful software is crashing down. What used to require large, specialized teams is now becoming accessible to a single motivated person.I wanted to share this because my journey into entrepreneurship was accidental and born out of a family need. But it showed me a real-world problem that I'm now passionate about solving. And the tools we have access to today are making it possible to build solutions that were unthinkable for a solo founder just a couple of years ago.", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "Hey everyone,I’ve been deep in the cold email game for a while and recently scaled to ~700k emails per month. I figured I’d share the stack I’m using, along with honest pros/cons of each tool, since I see a lot of people asking how to do this at scale without burning domains or killing deliverability.Data SourcesApollo – Great for bulk lead lists. Easy filters, tons of data, and the integrations are solid. Downside: quality can be hit or miss depending on the industry. I still double-check higher-value accounts.LinkedIn Sales Navigator – Not really built for scale, but still one of the best for targeted outreach. Perfect when you’re going after decision-makers and want accurate, up-to-date job titles.Email VerificationBrandNav – Honestly one of the most important parts of my stack. If you’re sending this volume, you cannot afford high bounce rates. BrandNav cleans lists quickly and I’ve seen better deliverability since using it.Inboxes PuzzleInbox (Google Workspace) – Makes managing and rotating inboxes smoother than doing it manually. Helps avoid the \"all your domains burn at once\" problem.Slicey (Outlook 365) – Similar to PuzzleInbox but for Outlook. Having both Google and Outlook accounts in my stack assist with deliverability.PersonalizationClay – When the offer justifies it (e.g., high-ticket B2B), Clay is a beast. You can enrich data, pull insights, and generate personalized snippets at scale. For campaigns where volume is more important than custom touches, I keep it simple with dynamic merge tags.Sending ToolInstantly.ai – The backbone of my sending operation. Handles inbox rotation, warmup, and sending logic automatically. Super clean UI, fast to deploy campaigns, and the deliverability features make it worth it.At this scale, the real challenge isn’t just sending, it’s keeping deliverability healthy. The key lessons I’ve learned:Diversify inboxes (both Google & Outlook). Clean data relentlessly (never skip verification). Don’t overdo personalization unless it directly impacts ROI. Monitor metrics daily (open/reply rates, bounce rates, domain health).That’s my stack. Would love to hear from others running 100k+ emails/month — what tools are you using for inbox management or list cleaning? Always curious if there’s something better out there.", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "I thought I’d get 1,000 users on launch day. Reality check: I got 4. Here’s how I clawed my way to 100 in 2 weeks.The excitement surrounding launch day is exaggerated. People rarely show up unless you actively pull them in. However, after two weeks of relentless effort, over 100 individuals were using my tool, and we received a Featured badge from Google.Here are five strategies that proved effective:Responding to complaints on Twitter. I searched for tweets saying “I dislike managing XYZ” and suggested my product as a solution in my replies.Reddit posts focused on problems first. Rather than simply sharing links, I outlined the issues I was addressing, and only after people expressed interest did I provide the link.Joining an early adopters Slack group. I became part of a “makers” Slack and shared my experience, leading to 20 people immediately trying my tool.Creating an email drip campaign for the waitlist. Instead of merely “launching,” I sent tips to those on the waitlist via email and gently encouraged them to test the product.Encouraging early reviews. I openly told users: “Your review could help secure a Featured badge,” and it was effective.If you’re experiencing anxiety about growth, concentrate on one authentic channel. That’s sufficient to get started.", "target": "negative"}
{"text": "Earlier this summer I sold about $420 worth of home décor items through my shop. Everything was legit. Tracking showed delivered, I even had emails from the buyer confirming they received the package and were happy with it. A month later I still got hit with a chargeback for “unauthorized transaction.” The funds were frozen and I spent days piecing together evidence stressing over this whole ordeal, plus submitting the whole evidence and waiting days for an answer.This stuff is very annoying and it really gave me a hard time, I'm fairly new at this stuff and 400 being frozen or potentially lost because some AH decided he wanted MY PRODUCT for FREE is terrifying. I've decided on the more streamlined approach since then and I've never felt better with everything being automatically collected and submitted. I need to know how I can manage a little better and maybe deal better with my customers because that's something that I'm still not very good at.

{"text": "The SaaS Boilerplate I Built After 3 Failed LaunchesI used to think my ideas weren’t good enough. But after my 3rd SaaS project failed, I realized the real problem wasn’t my ideas—it was the months I wasted rebuilding the same boilerplate over and over.So instead of starting another SaaS, I built the kit I wish I had from the beginning. I called it Indie Kit. It has multi-tenant B2B features, admin impersonation, support for multiple payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, LemonSqueezy, Dodopayments), and the kind of architecture you usually only add after hitting scaling pain.The wild part? It’s now used by 300+ devs who were stuck in the exact same cycle I was. The most unexpected feedback I’ve gotten?
