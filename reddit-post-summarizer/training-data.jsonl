{"text": "Our car, which I share with my wife, is new enough that it has Bluetooth to connect to the audio system, steering wheel controls, etc. but old enough that it only allows a single device to be stored in its memory. It's impractical to delete and store a new device every time we swap over between the two of us so our solution has been that my wife has the Bluetooth slot while I have a Bluetooth adapter that transmits to an FM channel that I use when I am driving. This is a suboptimal solution because the audio quality is bad, there is regularly interference from random radio stations on long journeys, and I can't use the steering wheel controls to answer calls, change tracks, etc. What I am looking for is a Bluetooth bridge device. Something that stays connected to the car, and which we both can pair to easily. Something that would relay the audio from our phone to the car and signals from the steering wheel controls to our phones. But it seems like a really niche thing. Do you think it might exist? Looking around I can find plenty of Bluetooth FM transmitter devices, or devices that operate either on TX or RX mode, but nothing that fills this two way passthrough function that I want. I should add that I'm not looking to have both our phones connected at the same time necessarily. Just something that is easy to pair with. It may be that we could find something that we can both connect to and then easily flip between which device is connected to the car, a bit like an HDMI switch. Any ideas?", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "I'm in the UK. I'm looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up. There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they'd be complicated to use - I'd be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I'd forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made. Something like this would be pretty much perfect: https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr# - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there's no \"hidden state\" - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don't have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don't really want next to my bed. (I don't mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don't want a constant noise) I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn't change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want. Something like this https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3 looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote \" It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all \" and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don't have full words on them. I have no idea what \"CD\" means in that context. Another reviewer said \" I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc. \" It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn't be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep. I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there's a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it. Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket.", "target": "positive"}

Instead of swiping endlessly on people with no context, HUE helps you meet, date, and make friends with others who share (or are curious about) your cultural background. You can connect with people from 20+ different ethnicities, explore prompts that highlight identity & interests, and join group chats to build real communities. Why did I build this? As a Nigerian American in the diaspora, Ive always loved Nigerian culture - Afrobeats, Nollywood, and everything in between - but I realized I didnt have a big enough community around me to share that love with. That gap inspired me to create HUE. I wanted a space where people could celebrate who they are, meet others who share their interests, and form relationships rooted in authenticity. Why HUE is different: Culture-first profiles (show who you are & where youre from) Meet people for friendship, dating, or networking Group chats to easily form communities with the people youve connected with Built-in icebreakers so conversations flow naturally Download link (iOS):  HUE on the App Store This is still early, so any feedback is super appreciated.

{"text": "Thanks for reading. I'll try to keep it short. My family has a small tire shop / auto repair business. It used to have multiple locations all over our city. It now only has two locations. My uncle (68yo) is pressuring my Dad (71yo) to retire and sell his location. My Dad is now pressuring me to find partners and buy his Tire Store / Repair Shop. He hasn't given me a number but I am guessing about 1.1 Million. He seems to think that me and my friends/partners should easily be able to come up with a loan to purchase it. He hasn't been managing it too closely the last couple years and it takes in about 5k-9k or more in revenue a day ( this is based off anecdotal evidence when I was doing the deposit at the end of the day last year). I am currently employed as a teacher (probably one of the few with a State Inspection and Emission license) and finally reached the top of my pay scale (about 110k a year). The only debt I have is about 50k left on my home and about 40k left on my wife's student loans. I (43yo) have worked here continuously since I was 15. Even being a teacher for the last 20 years I came in after school and have run the counter, changed tires, done inspections and light maintenance. I am mostly terrified of having to pay for auto maintenance that I can't do in my drive way. Does anyone think that if I got at least one if not two partners we could secure a small business loan? Might there be another way to finance this? Thanks, I am clueless. Addendum: My Dad and uncle are on the outs. He has been told he can retire and collect a paycheck but he is not welcome in his store. So my dad is kind of hoping I can buy his location so he can have both the money and the location to have his car and tires serviced.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "As of Friday I'm in discussions to buy a local repair shop. The purchase will be the assets under a new LLC that I have yet to form. I have an experienced CPA in my family that will review and I am currently seeking a transaction lawyer and bank. The owner has repeatedly told his acquaintances in front of me that I am the one buying the shop and has expressed to me various other parties have been very interested including an offer over his asking price and stated he informed them I was already \"the buyer\". There are a few problems so far, one being my inexperience. The other is the seller is a boomer and is sort of handwaving the whole thing in the most literal \"I know what I got\" sense. To wit the only numbers I have are a profit and loss statement from 2023 and 2024. I've requested the to date 2025 p&l plus balance sheets from the same years and tax statements from 2022-2024 and gotten no response (not unreasonable as it is the weekend over which all of this has occurred). In addition I've asked for an asset list but instead got walked around the shop, told of a few issues, shown the on-hand inventory room and had it handwaved as \"all this\". It's a viable business doing poorly but on top of my agenda is a true asset list because I have to know what I'm buying. I mean there are literally no details, such as is there a shop owned vehicle? Is the wall art included? I mean there is literally no way to value the assets without knowing what they are. At the very least it seems like I'd need this information for the bank as I intend for the assets to be the collateral under the LLC. There are many other open boxes on my checklist such as key employee retention and ensuring the landlord is going to honor the existing lease, and the actual lease details which I have yet to even get verbal details save the dollar amount. US state, \"at-will\" employment. When I mentioned reviewing a purchase agreement contract he seemed like that is something I would be providing, which to me was just insanely weird. As far a a training period, as I have no experience in this industry, he has repeatedly stated that he is just going to stay on and keep doing the exact same things. That's a whole other issue as I intend to change everything and not just be some wallflower intern holding the bag while he continues to pretend he owns the business. Just a red flag for later, I don't intend to press the point until we have a contract which I believe should include his ongoing involvement. I'm convinced he would void the whole transaction if he knew I planned to change anything if not everything. In addition I am recalcitrant to share my ideas for improvement before obtaining ownership. In the most mundane sense it seems like he would expect the aforementioned wall art to remain, but also himself remain in ownership of it. At leat that's my impression, and I don't want to test that this early in the process. I mean this to be an anchor post for what I assume are many, many questions during the process as I have never owned a business. I feel like I'm buying a truck from this guy and he doesn't want me to look under the hood. I expect it's bad based on the P&L but how bad and is it fixable are outstanding questions. The biggest sticking point I have right now is the lack of financial documentation and the asset list. The few most pressing questions are: What do I look for in a bank or credit union, or is there a service that will shop around for my loan? Apart from business loan is there any type I should be seeking (analogous to 30 year home mortgage)? What will they likely want apart from my information? Realistically what kind of timeline should I expect, assuming the financials are provided, from setup of the LLC to loan application to legal issues?", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "I'm a highly experienced technical project manager (digital transformation, cybersecurity, web product development) in the DC area looking to get formal product training, since my experience has been much more heavily weighted to the project side of things than product. I'd prefer fully online coursework, but I would also highly value the strength of the networking opportunities, since this is currently a weak point for me. Any insights on the pros / cons of the two options below would be greatly appreciated. Background: I have an undergraduate degree in cybersecurity, and will complete an MS in Cybersecurity Management & Policy soon. This is at an online school (UMGC), which does not have a strong alumni networking presence even here in the DMW. Certified Scrum Master, Advanced Certified Scrum Master, and I'll most likely have the PMP this year, but nothing specifically product-focused. Undergrad GPA is terrible, grad school GPA is 4.0 so far. I also have three cybersecurity certs in my pipeline for this year, but as with my degree, nothing product-specific. Option 1: UIUC's MS. Management or MBA. The MSM degree stacks into the MBA if I wanted to add that next year. Business degree from a strong engineering school, great global alumni network (they have alumni meetups here in DC, alumni are engaged and available to chat with prospective students, everyone I've talked to has repeatedly mention the value of mentorship, job referrals, etc). Has an opportunity for an annual in-person alumni networking event that everyone raves about, plus in-person project groups at US and international locations once or twice a year. This is a general-purpose management degree. The global exposure and networks are of interest me as much of my career has been international, and I'm extremely interested in working internationally again in the future. Option 2: University of Maryland's Product Management Master's. Also a great engineering school. Uncertain how engaged or active the alumni network is for referrals, but here in the DMV where the next several years of my career will be, UMD grads are absolutely everywhere. Very good local reputation. I'm also just outside campus and on their shuttle route, so it'd be really nice to be back in an academic environment again, have access to student groups, have spaces to work or work out, and just be more engaged and out of my house, even though the program itself is entirely online. The professor who founded the program did an in-depth career call with me, was extremely well-prepared, and is someone I'd love to have as a mentor or in my network. I've attended a couple of their alumni presentations as well, and they're impressive people. This is a much more focused degree specifically on product management. Thoughts?

At first it was just something I wanted for myself because I couldnt find anything on Mac that felt right. Either the apps were ugly, or slow, or locked behind subscriptions. I thought it would stay a small side project but it grew way faster than I imagined. Heres where things are right now  8,367 active users  742 paying customers  $6,761 in revenue  33,000 visitors and 62,000 page views on the site I spent nothing on ads. All the growth came from Reddit, a couple of posts going semi-viral, and people sharing it around. At one point it even got picked up by 3 Telegram channels with over 2M subscribers , which brought a huge wave of new users. Some takeaways so far  Free plan matters more than you think. People want to try without limits before committing.  Subscriptions are a dealbreaker for something like wallpapers. One-time payment works much better.  Distribution beats everything. You can have the nicest product but unless you share it in the right spots, no one finds it. This is still very early but Im curious how far I can push it. I didnt expect a project I made in my room to turn into thousands in revenue in such a short time. Makes me think the ceiling is way higher than I thought.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "Ive been coding for about 20 years, and for the past year Ive been building most of my projects with AI. Honestly, AI has given me a massive productivity boost, taught me tons of new things, and yeah sometimes its been a real headache too  I thought Id share some lessons from my own experience. Maybe theyll save you some time (and stress) if youre starting to build with AI.  Early Lessons Dont ask for too much at once. One of my biggest mistakes: dumping a giant list of tasks into a single prompt. The output is usually messy and inconsistent. Break it down into small steps and validate each one. You still have to lead. AI is creative, but youre the developer. Use your experience to guide the direction. Ask for a spec first. Instead of just code it, I often start by having AI write a short feature spec. Saves a lot of mistakes later.  Code & File Management The same file in multiple windows = can be painful. Ive lost hours because I had the same file open in different editors, restored something, and overwrote changes. Commit and push often. Watch for giant files. AI loves to dump everything into one 2000+ line file. Every now and then, tell it to split things up, create new classes in new files and keep responsibilities small. Use variables for names/domains. If you hardcode your app name or domain everywhere, youll regret it when you need to change them. Put them in a config from the start.  Working with Chats Going back to old chats is risky. If you reopen a conversation from a few days ago and add new requests, sometimes it wipes out the context (or overwrites everything done since then). For new topics, start a new chat. Long chats get sluggish. As threads grow, responses slow down and errors creep in. I ask for a quick summary of changes so far, copy that, and continue fresh in a new chat. Much faster. Try different models. Sometimes one model stalls on a problem, and another handles it instantly. Dont lock yourself to a single tool.  Safety & Databases Never just run it. A careless SQL command can accidentally delete all your data. Always review before execution. Show AI your DB schema. Download your structure and let AI suggest improvements or highlight redundant tables. Sometimes I even paste a single tables CREATE statement at the bottom of my prompt as a little P.S. , surprisingly effective. Backups are life-saving. Regular backups saved me more than once. Code goes to GitHub; DB I back up with my own scripts or manual exports. Ask for security/optimization checks. Every so often, Ill say do a quick security + performance review. Its caught things I missed.  When Youre Stuck When I hit a wall, Ill ask AI to list possible steps. I dont just follow blindly, but it gives me a clear map to make the final call myself. And if things really start going sideways, dont wait too long, restart from scratch, get the small steps right first, and then move forward.  Wrap-up For me, AI has been the biggest accelerator Ive seen in 20 years of development. But its also something you need to handle carefully. I like to think of it as a super-fast medior developer : insanely productive, but if you dont keep an eye on it, it can still cause problems  Curious what others have learned too :) EDIT  A couple more things I forgot earlier:  If Im starting a bigger project , I sometimes kick it off with a system like Lovable, Rork, or Bolt to get the structure in place, then continue on GitHub with Cursor AI. This workflow has worked well for me so far , less cost, faster iteration, and minimal setup.  Sometimes I even ask AI : If I had to make you redo what you just did, what exact prompt would you want from me? Then I restart fresh with that   In Cursor I also upload extra context when needed , a screenshot, a code snippet, or even a JSON file. It really helps guide the AI and speeds things up. And if something still cant be solved in Cursor, I restart in Max Mode. It often produces smarter and more comprehensive solutions. Then of course I switch back to Auto Mode so I dont burn through all my tokens  Every now and then I ask the AI to  explain the whole system to me from scratch . It works as a memory refresh both for myself and for the AI. I sometimes copy-paste this summary at the beginning of new chats and continue from there.  One of the most effective ways to spot errors and keep track of the system is simple console log tracking . Just copy-paste the errors you see into the chat , even without extra explanation, AI understands and immediately starts working on a fix.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "Hey folks, I launched a simple receipt scanning app called Receipto back in May  it was a chill weekend build, meant to work completely offline. No cloud, no fancy AI, just scan and organize receipts locally. I honestly forgot about it for a few months while focusing on another project. A while ago, I posted about Receipto here on Reddit, even though the app wasnt in the best shape back then. But I got some super helpful and constructive feedback from the community, which motivated me to improve it and push a much better version. Fast forward to last week: I won a free promo spot on Indie App Santa (shoutout to them), and as I was prepping for the launch, I dropped the price to free for a few hours. Somehow, AppRaven (and maybe AppAdvice, too?) picked it up. In just 3 days , Receipto hit 19,000 downloads , mostly from Asia. The promo ended, the price went back up, and people actually started subscribing. It made $275 , which is more than what my main app did recently  That gave me the push to properly update it  I added AI-powered scanning (OpenAI & Gemini), optional cloud sync, export/import, recurring transactions, and fixed a bunch of bugs.

{"text": "Built this because my 11yo kid was missing effective ways to practise for her exams. I made her flashcards and quizzes by hand like it was 1995. She sure learnt that way too, but that got me thinking that not every kid have parent with that much free time on their hands. So I started building what I wished existed: kid takes picture of geology notes about plate margins, gets immediate practise that expose gaps in understanding. The photo constraint isn't just better UX, it's the only way to get usable output from that age group. They don't understand prompting. They'd type \"make quiz plz\" and get confused when it asks for context. So point phone, get quiz. The app takes 44 steps (AI prompting, context explanation, output formatting) and makes it one step (point camera). Consistent format, calibrated difficulty, no hallucinated facts. Kids 10-15 get the worst deal in edtech, even when this is the age when learning habits actually form. They are too advanced for baby apps, too young for adult tools. They get gamification theater instead: points, streaks, engagement mechanics that feel good but teach nothing. I stripped all that out. Photo determines content, AI determines difficulty, testing reveals gaps. No escape routes. Also, no ads, no trackers, no data selling. Photos stay on device.

{"text": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My names Rob & I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts. A couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day. I started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently. First off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS \"guru\" preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different. My secrets to a successful launch day: Building in Stealth: I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready. Posted screenshots asking \"who wants to try this?\" - no product links DMed interested people to join private beta Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better Built hype so launch day went that much better Launch Day Momentum: When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD. Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials  50,000 views Screenshot PostHog analytics  20,000 views Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard  10,000 views Every win becomes content that drives more wins Why Photos Matter: Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples attention. People root for underdogs (probably you) Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era) The Numbers Game: 70 free trials in 24 hours 50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%) 200,000+ views on X in 24hrs 95% of traffic from organic X posts Over 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, Im at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending. Ask me anything about: Failing 5 times and what I learned Building in \"stealth\" while still posting publicly Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta Launch day execution Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else Goal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year. After 5 failures, it finally feels possible. Happy to share specific tactics, screenshots, or just commiserate about the SaaS grind :) Let's gooo!

{"text": "A good friend of mine who's been in B2B sales for over 20 years recently shared something with me that completely shifted how I see prospecting and outreach. He didnt get a reply. He didnt have a meeting booked. There was no introduction or referral. Just a single like from a prospect on one of his LinkedIn posts. That was it. From that tiny moment of engagement, one that most salespeople would ignore, he ended up closing a $72,000 deal. What struck me wasnt just the outcome, but the way he explained the process. Hes no longer chasing people with cold DMs or relying on generic filters to build lists. Instead, hes paying attention to what he calls dynamic social signals. Little behaviors that indicate interest, curiosity, or intent, even if theyre subtle. He looks for signs like someone viewing his LinkedIn profile. Liking a competitors post. Following someone in his space. Commenting on a post related to the problem his product solves. Attending an event. Engaging in a niche discussion. To most people, those dont feel like leads. But to him, theyre the start of a conversation. When someone interacts with something even loosely related to his offer, he uses that as context to send a thoughtful message. Not a pitch. Not an automated sequence. Just a relevant piece of content, a short insight, or a question tailored to what the prospect showed interest in. He told me about a VP who viewed his profile after reading a post about ROI in telecom. Instead of pitching right away, he connected with that person and then 3 days later dropped a short message with a case study on how his product increased ROI for a similar client. The VP replied the same day. In another case, a director liked a post by an influencer talking about a problem his product solves. He followed up with a simple value-first message offering help, no strings attached. That turned into a call the same week. This method gives him four times more replies, four times more acceptance, and over 90 percent of people who respond are actually qualified. Its a simple formula. High intent plus perfect timing equals real conversations that convert. This kind of sales isnt loud. Its not spammy, based on listening, not chasing. And it works ! Good luck.

{"text": "Ive built enough SaaS products for clients to know that this is probably the most misunderstood piece of advice in the entire industry. It sounds right. It feels right. And it leads more teams down the wrong path than almost anything else. I know, it sounds like heresy. But let me explain. Every client I work with has a backlog full of feature requests straight from their users. \"We need a dark mode.\" \"Can you add a CSV export button?\" \"We want more dashboard widgets.\" The impulse is always the same: \"Our users are asking for this, so we have to build it.\" And so they do. They build the dark mode, the export button, the extra widgets. And nothing changes. Engagement doesn't go up. Churn doesn't go down. The product just gets more bloated and harder to maintain. Here's the problem nobody talks about: Users are experts at their problems, but they are terrible at designing solutions. When a user asks for a feature, what they're really doing is describing a symptom and guessing at the cure. Your job isn't to be a short-order cook and build whatever they ask for. Your job is to be a doctor and diagnose the underlying disease. I had a client whose users were constantly asking for a \"better way to export data.\" They were convinced they needed more formats, more options, more filters. We spent weeks going back and forth on the design. Finally, I got on the phone with five of those users and asked a simple question: \"What do you do with the data right after you export it?\" Four of them said they manually clean it up and import it into QuickBooks. The problem wasn't the export feature. The problem was they couldn't get their financial data into their accounting software. The real solution wasn't a better export button; it was a native QuickBooks integration. We built that instead, and it became their single biggest driver of upgrades. Here's the framework I use now that saves my clients from themselves: Treat every feature request as a starting point, not an endpoint. The request is the beginning of your investigation, not the conclusion. Always ask \"why\" five times. \"Why do you need a CSV export?\" \"So I can get my data out.\" \"Why do you need to get your data out?\" \"So I can put it in another system.\" \"Why do you need it in that system?\" You get the idea. Watch what they do, not just what they say. Session recordings are gold. You'll often see users struggling with a workflow they can't even articulate properly. Solve the problem, not the request. A user asking for a faster horse doesn't actually want a faster horse. They want to get from point A to point B more quickly. The solution might be a car. I'm not saying you should ignore your users. You absolutely should listen to their problems, their frustrations, and their goals. But the moment you start letting them design your product roadmap, you've already lost. You're the product expert. They're the user expert. Your job is to translate their pain into an elegant solution. Stop taking orders and start diagnosing. Your product will be a thousand times better for it. End of rant.

{"text": "Every single day I see more proof that AI is completely changing how fast products get built. A friend told me about someone who took an existing SaaS product and rebuilt most of the core features in just one weekend using AI tools. I read about another guy who launched a Chrome extension in 24 hours, and it actually made it to the front page of Product Hunt. There are stories about small teams cloning full YC startup products just for practice, sometimes even adding a little twist and putting it live the same week. This used to sound impossible. Before AI you needed months of planning, a dev team, and funding just to get something usable. Now one person with no budget can sit down, use AI to generate code, use another AI for UI design, and have a working product in less than a week. Hosting is free, domains are cheap, and marketing is just posting online. The cost of failure is basically zero so people do not even care if an idea fails anymore. They just try again and again until something sticks. The scary part is not just speed. It is that ideas no longer feel safe. If I can make something today, there is nothing stopping ten other people from rebuilding the same thing tomorrow, polishing it a little more, and pushing it with better marketing. Even established companies with money and teams can clone and launch something at insane speed. Execution speed is becoming more important than originality itself. To see how real this is I decided to test it myself. In just 2 days I built an MVP with AI guidance. It is live right now. It reduces heavy manual compliance work for firms and anonymizes data before AI processes it so privacy stays protected. I did this with zero budget, just AI and free hosting, and it actually works. This made me stop and think. If an MVP like this can be built in 2 days, what is the point of spending months building something from scratch. Are products even safe anymore when AI has lowered the barrier this much. Maybe the real challenge is not building but getting attention fast enough before someone else copies the idea. I do not know the answer but it feels like we have entered a new era where speed and distribution beat almost everything else.", "target": "positive"}

The intricacies of the business model are one of my favourite things to discuss and unfortunately theyre not exactly subjects to discuss socially at a party. Which is why this Sub is important!

The LinkedIn Events strategy: Go to LinkedIn search and type your target industry (marketing) Click on the Events tab Find large events with 10k+ attendees Click Attend Browse the attendee list to identify potential prospects Pro filtering tips : Prioritize younger professionals, who are often more open to trying new tools Step 2: Send Strategic Connection Requests Always use desktop. It lets you add a personalized note, which improves acceptance rates. Keep the message short and simple. Example: Hey [Name], saw we were both in the [industry] space, would love to connect. Best, [Your Name] Step 3: Build Rapport Before Pitching Dont pitch right after someone accepts. Wait. Sometimes theyll even reply first. The next day: Check if they posted recently Like their post and leave a thoughtful comment Make it meaningful (avoid Great post) Step 4: Craft Your Outreach Message Use the problem-first approach. Structure it like this: Greet and reference the connection Mention your app briefly with 1-2 features Ask about their daily challenges Offer value, such as early access, free trial, or a discount Example: Hi [Name], thanks for connecting! Im working on [brief app description]. Im always looking to make it more valuable for [their role]. Whats something you struggle with day-to-day that you wish there was a better solution for? Your insights would be very helpful, and Id love to offer early access if it could help. Step 5: Handle Responses Perfect match: Theyre interested, and your app fits their need Feature opportunity: Theyre not a fit now, but their feedback gives you valuable insights No response/not interested: It happens. This approach still outperforms most others Bonus: Optimize Your Profile Use a clear, professional-looking photo (doesnt need a studio shoot) Write a strong headline and About section that explain what you do Make it easy for prospects to understand your expertise and story Have a website in your bio so prospects can book calls without talking to you Key Takeaways : Quality over quantity: Target the right people Build relationships first: Engage before pitching Focus on problems: Lead with their challenges, not your features Be patient: Genuine outreach takes time Stay authentic: People respond better to real conversations than to polished scripts This system has consistently delivered better results than any other outreach method Ive tried. While no approach works 100% of the time, focusing on relationships and problem-solving creates connections that often turn into long-term business. You can do this 100% manually or automate it at scale. Good luck ! Romn from gojiberry.AI", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "Ok so this is gonna sound weird but building TuBoost solo for 18 days has made me realize I might not actually be an introvert... I might just be terrible at asking people for help lol Like I'll spend 6 hours debugging something that probably has a 2-minute solution if I just asked someone who's done it before. But instead of reaching out I'm googling random Stack Overflow posts from 2015 and hoping they apply to my specific edge case  The solo founder thing is so contradictory too... like you need to be comfortable working alone but also constantly networking and talking to users. Some days I love the independence, other days I'm staring at my laptop wondering if I'm slowly going insane from lack of human interaction. Had this moment yesterday where I was stuck on a payment processing bug and spent HOURS trying different solutions. Finally posted in a Discord server and got the answer in 10 minutes. Made me realize how much time I waste being stubborn about figuring everything out myself. But also asking for help feels vulnerable? Like admitting you don't know something means admitting you might not be qualified to build this thing. Impostor syndrome but make it entrepreneurial lol. The building in public thing helps because at least I feel connected to other builders even if we're all struggling separately. But it's still weird to share progress with strangers online while avoiding asking friends and family for actual advice. Customer support has been the biggest eye-opener though... like I'll spend days building features I think people want instead of just asking my existing 35 users what they actually need. Social anxiety disguised as product development strategy  Anyone else deal with this? Like being comfortable with the technical challenges but weird about the human parts of building a business? The networking advice everyone gives feels impossible when you're naturally conflict-avoidant and overthink every interaction. \"Just reach out to potential customers!\" Ok but what if they think I'm annoying?? Weirdest part is I'm fine posting vulnerable updates on Reddit but terrified to send a cold email to someone who might actually use my product. The internet makes no sense. How do you push through the social discomfort of entrepreneurship when your natural instinct is to hide behind your computer and hope customers find you organically? Also is it normal to feel lonely while simultaneously avoiding opportunities to connect with people? Because that's definitely my current vibe and it seems counterproductive lol. The solo thing is both my biggest strength and weakness... love the independence but maybe I'd be further along if I actually talked to humans more often", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "Duuude the AI hype is making me feel like I'm living in a different universe... everyone's building \"AI-powered this\" and \"machine learning that\" while I'm over here celebrating that my file upload form works in Safari lmao Like I see posts about \"AI revolutionizing X industry\" and \"GPT wrapper makes $100k MRR\" and I'm just trying to build TuBoost.io without the payment processing breaking when someone uses an apostrophe in their name  Don't get me wrong, my app uses AI for video processing and it's genuinely useful. But 90% of my work is boring shit like database optimization, error handling, and figuring out why the mobile UI looks like garbage on older phones. Meanwhile everyone's raising millions for \"AI agents that do your laundry\" or whatever and I'm wondering if I'm completely missing the boat by focusing on... actually making stuff work? The pressure to be \"AI-first\" is insane though. Like I'll describe TuBoost as \"video processing tool\" and people are like \"cool story bro\" but if I say \"AI-powered content optimization platform\" suddenly everyone's interested. Same exact product, different buzzwords. Had this conversation with another founder who was like \"you should add ChatGPT integration to everything\" and I'm thinking... my users just want their videos to process without errors, they don't need AI to write their video descriptions lol But also what if I'm wrong? What if I should be building chatbots and AI assistants instead of solving actual workflow problems? The FOMO is real and I keep second-guessing whether I'm building the right thing. The funny part is most \"AI startups\" I've seen are just regular software with GPT API calls sprinkled on top. Like we're all using the same OpenAI models but some people are better at marketing it as revolutionary. Anyone else feeling this pressure to AI-ify everything even when it doesn't make sense? Or am I just being stubborn by focusing on core functionality over trendy features? Honestly starting to think the real skill isn't building AI, it's knowing when NOT to use AI and just solve problems with boring reliable technology.

Like, I know I haven't used many website editors and I get that this is supposed to be for beginners but holy shit this has been the most frustrating thing I've ever had to do. I genuinely wish I never started this. Like if I had to make a website builder, this would literally be my perfect example of what NOT to do. Nothing is consistent!! It'll constantly make random changes - like cropping my logo differently every single time for no reason?? And stuff just isn't where it would make logical sense to put it. The editor is just... it's so poor. And then - AND THEN - all they do is try to get you to use their premium bullshit. I'm trying to do something simple and they're constantly trying to sell me these \"premium services\" that their website can supposedly provide. It's absolutely mind-boggling. Look, I haven't used any other website builders, but if I hadn't already spent so much time trying to push through this nightmare, I would tell everyone: DO NOT use Wix. Do literally anything else. I genuinely just came here to post this because I've spent the last WEEK trying to get this website to look halfway decent and I'm just losing my mind. Like why is everything so inconsistent??

{"text": "Hey everyone, I've been researching why small businesses struggle to get consistent customer reviews, and I discovered something interesting: timing is everything. Studies show that customer satisfaction peaks within the first 3 days after a service experience, but that's exactly when most businesses go silent. I'm developing a software to solve this timing gap. Instead of hoping customers remember to leave reviews weeks later, it automatically reaches out during that optimal window when they're most engaged and willing to share feedback. Some valuable insights I've uncovered that might help any business owners here: 72% of customers will leave a review if asked at the right time vs. only 15% who do it spontaneously Automated follow-up increases review volume by 200-300% on average The 3-7 day window has 4x higher response rates than requests sent after 2+ weeks Businesses with consistent review flow see 23% more foot traffic (according to BrightLocal's 2024 study) Quick validation question for business owners: What's your biggest challenge with getting customer feedback - is it timing, knowing who to ask, or something else entirely?

{"text": "TL;DR: I built PRYSM, an AI-powered app that lets creators sell products directly inside DMs/comments section. Our AI stack (IntentAnalysis + VisionService + DynamicPricing) figures out exactly what the customer wants, then generates the correct instant checkout link. Launching Sept 16  prysmpage.vercel.app Heres the problem every creator knows: A fan says I want that  under your post but youve got 10 products. Which one do they mean? You DM back  too slow. You send them to your site  they drop off. Or the message gets buried under 50 others.  Thats sales leaking out of your DMs. So I built PRYSM. Think Stripe for social media sales  but smarter. How it works (the AI under the hood): Creator uploads products into PRYSM. Sets trigger keywords inside PRYSM (I want that, how much etc). Connects socials (Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Twitter). When a fan comments or DMs:  IntentAnalysis Service  understands what they meant, not just what they typed. (Yo can I grab that hoodie? still maps correctly.)  VisionService  scans the creators post itself (the product in the photo/video). It cross-checks against your PRYSM catalog so when a customer says I want that, PRYSM knows which product theyre pointing at and tells generateLink.ts which checkout link to build.  DynamicPricingSuggestion Service  smartly recommends discounts, bundles, or upsells depending on demand and buyer behavior. 4. PRYSM instantly replies with the correct 1-click checkout link. 5. Customer taps  mobile checkout (just that product)  purchase complete in <30 seconds. 6. Creator gets notified + fulfillment details in their dashboard. Why i think it matters: No back-and-forth. No abandoned Shopify carts. No lost sales because a fan wasnt crystal clear. Just  I want that  instant sale. Traction so far 1,200+ creators already on the waitlist. 15 carefully handpicked beta testers using it right now and giving me feedback.  Features: Multi-platform integration Stripe + PayPal support Real-time notifications Analytics & inventory management Automated responses Were launching September 16. Early signups get: Priority access Lifetime 50% off Chance to shape the product with feedback  Join waitlist here: prysmpage.vercel.app Id love to hear from creators/founders: Whats the most frustrating DM sale youve lost?

{"text": "Hey everyone, Every time I launch a new app, I waste way too much time trying to find good places to submit it. Id Google launch directories, end up on old blog posts, and then scramble to make a messy list for myself. At first, I just had a simple Excel spreadsheet with 52 launch directories that I shared on Reddit . It got over 400 upvotes, which was awesome! But people kept asking for more: like domain ratings, traffic stats, dofollow links, and even more sites. So I finally just made one solid list of 80 launch directories that actually matter. Sites like Product Hunt, Hacker News, Indie Hackers, AngelList, and a bunch of others where people really look for new apps and tools. Whats cool is that most folks visiting these directories are indie hackers, developers, and founders, so basically people like us. And yeah, they might be the perfect audience for your app. Maybe your habit tracker or whatever youre building could help them out too. I also added DR next to each site so you get a sense of how much traffic or SEO value they might bring.

{"text": "I recently bought a bubble tea franchise. The franchisor requires new owners to attend 7 days of training and then keep the same trainees working for at least 30 days after opening. Because I was short on people, I asked my aunt-in-law and her cousin (lets call him John) to attend training with me. I pay John a fair salary ( $1000/ month), so this is not unpaid family help. The problem: John acts like a clown. He's the type that think he's being funny but is really just a jackass. In our official work group chat (which includes my parents, the actual owners, and the franchisor staff), he changes the group name to things like The Royal Court, pins random jokes, and generally behaves unprofessionally. This is very frustrating because:  Im the manager responsible for running the shop.  My parents are the owners, so I lose face when he acts out.  The franchisor requires him to stay for at least 30 days, so I cant just replace him immediately. And really, this dude is just really annoying in generall.

I just did a brutally honest conversation with Thomas from Uneed, and holy shit, it hit different. TD;LR This guy failed 30+ projects before one finally worked. Not 3. Not 5. THIRTY. The Graveyard of \"Almost Made Its\"  His GitHub is literally a cemetery of abandoned repos here's a list of his failed saas: Gumaffiliates - Marketplace for Gumroad sellers. Made $500 in 2 years. RIP. - Freeesbee - Built in a day for product feedback. Never even launched it. - SeeduryFor - A \"really useless\" planning app he only used himself - Uneed Gaming (2024) - Uneed but for video games. Didn't work. Plus stuff like lstnr, wordnuxt, equilibre (a SaaS boilerplate), Cineplex, minbird, zephyr, whatisanindiemaker, isthisfromeu, Windlib, Scribe, Uneed Hacking, Uneed No Code... the list goes on. What Uneed does: Uneed is a product launch platform where indie makers can launch their products and get discovered - basically Product Hunt but for indie/bootstrap founders instead of VC-backed startups. Makers submit products, users discover new tools. After reflecting on his failures, he identified these patterns: 1. The Week-Two Quit No sales after 14 days? Must be a shit idea. Wrong. Products rarely work overnight. The difference between failure and success is often just one more iteration 2. The Pretty Landing Page Paradox Your site has sick animations but nobody knows WTF you're selling? Congrats, you played yourself. If your headline doesn't explain it, nobody's scrolling. 3. Momentum Murder Build in public for 3 weeks  Stop posting  Wonder why nobody cares anymore. You literally have to start from zero every time you go silent. 4. Build It and They Will Come  Spoiler: They won't. Ever. No matter how good your features are. 5. Timing Denial Sometimes January isn't your month. But July might be. The market changes, trends shift. Persistence > Perfect Timing. The One That Finally Worked  Uneed started as a basic front-end tools directory making $200/month. Not exactly yacht money. Then he pivoted to a launch platform right when everyone was bitching about Product Hunt only featuring big VC-backed products. Revenue initially tanked (scary AF), but then... The Two Rules for Ideas That Actually Work After all his failures, he boiled it down to this: 1. You MUST know how to sell it - Understand the market - Have distribution channels - Know your customers' pain points With Gum Affiliates, he knew nothing about affiliates. With Uneed, he knew Product Hunt, indie hackers, and had already built his Twitter audience. 2. You NEED competitors \"You're not Steve Jobs. Creating a new market is nearly impossible.\" No competitors = No market = No money. Simple as that. His Tech Stack (For the Nerds) Framework: NuxtJS (not NextJs) Database: Supabase Emails: Bento Hosting: Self host on Hetzner VPS manage by Coolify Payments: Polar Analytics: Plausible The Advice That Actually Matters Forget the \"hustle 24/7\" bullshit: It's a marathon, not a sprint. You have the same chance of getting rich in a month as winning the lottery Don't sacrifice everything. He cycles, sees friends, has a life. Burnout kills more startups than competition Just build. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Actually, Thomas told me you don't need 30+ attempts - you can move way quicker if you follow the basic rules he learned the hard way. He just took the scenic route  and yeah if you want to learn from some real founders you can get them here The Bottom Line: Almost nobody has overnight success. There are YEARS of work behind every \"sudden\" success story you see But here's the thing if you don't build anything, you'll never know if project #31 could've been the on", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "4 years and 3 months ago (just checked my git log), I started building My Forever Books . A website where you can upload your text messages (iMessage, WhatsApp, SMS, etc.) and get them printed into a real, physical book. Top use cases being anniversary gifts or preserving the texts of family/friends that have passed. Exactly a year ago today, I made my first organic sale from a random customer in Tennessee. That moment pretty much changed everything for me, and I was convinced that I had real business with real potential. A month later, I quit my job and went all in on the business, right before the holiday gift giving season. Sales went crazy, my email was blowing up, and I was in front of my computer all day every day answering emails, getting on calls, fixing bugs, building features, and so much more. Although I started working the most I've ever had in my life, it was so rewarding and fulfilling, especially that I had built so many relationships with my customers and had received beautiful emails from them thanking me for making a service that really preserves something special. Till this day, I know most of my customers personally. It's been a wild journey with a ton of mistakes made. I remember the first version of the site felt like a saas page with zero emotional weight, whereas now, it's really starting to feel like a cohesive brand. Looking back and checking when I actually started coding the site, it's crazy to think that it's been over 4 years. But it makes sense, I remember working at my corporate job all day, to then try and work nights and weekends. It was pretty tough to code after an entire work day, and that's reflective in the amount of time it took me to initially build the site. The closer I got to going all in on the business, the more I stayed in a flow with building and the more I could get done. Once I was totally focused, I probably built more in 3 months than in 3 years. To anyone working on a side project, you can do it! Keep pivoting, keep believing in the vision, and be selective to who you listen to. You have to wear so many hats, but the longer you're in it, the better you get at everything. Not just building, but marketing and business. You also get your best ideas here in the flow! I have so many other niche ideas that I want to release soon, and I'm just feeling so confident with how fast they'll generate revenue because I know what to do now. At least... better than I did before. Stay focused, stay business savvy, give charity, and everything will work out.", "target": "positive"}

The idea is simple: show wait times for restaurants in minutes so you dont waste an hour standing in line.

From the dev side, I built it in SwiftUI with MapKit integration, async API calls, and a small disk cache so the UI loads instantly even on cold start.

We built and polished our product, held energetic team meetings, and set roadmap after roadmap. The result? $0 revenue, and not a single real customer. Looking back: I had completely underestimated the challenge of distribution . We could buildbut without an audience, nobody cared. Instead of trying to add yet another feature, I decided to switch gears and document my journey publicly, sharing raw, honest updates and lessons on Instagram and YouTube. The results in just 20 days: 200,000 views across platforms 1,000+ followers interested in our space Actual leads reaching out for conversations Unexpected support and feedback from the community Hard-earned lessons: Building in silence = building for yourself Audience-first wins: Start with distribution, not just product Content compounds; even imperfect stories beat polished demos Feedback from just a few real users teaches more than months at the whiteboard Now, Im focused almost entirely on building with my audience, sharing what works and what doesnt in real time.

{"text": "I discovered a strategy that completely transformed my cold email results, and while it seemed counterintuitive at first, it actually makes perfect sense when you think about it. The insight was simple: people who are active on LinkedIn are also more likely to respond to cold emails. Someone who regularly engages on social media, checks notifications, and responds to messages on one platform will probably do the same across other channels, including email. So I decided to test this theory. Instead of using static databases like Apollo, I started building my outreach campaigns exclusively from LinkedIn activity. I used Instantly with 140 domains, sending around 3,000 emails per day, but only targeted prospects showing recent LinkedIn engagement. Here's what I looked for: people commenting on posts with specific keywords, users engaging with industry creators, prospects interacting with competitor content, event attendees, group members, job changers, basically anyone showing they're actively using LinkedIn. Of course, I still filtered everything against my ideal customer profile. The results were incredible. I booked over 100 demos using this approach, and my reply rate tripled compared to traditional database outreach. The difference was night and day. What really made this work was the dynamic nature of the sourcing. While static databases get stale quickly, LinkedIn gives you fresh, engaged prospects every single day. New posts, new comments, new event attendees, new job announcements. The activity never stops. For example, just by following one industry creator this month, I pulled 5,000 leads from their engaged audience. Sure, there's some overlap when creators talk about similar topics, but the daily flow of new interactions keeps your pipeline full of fresh prospects. The trade off is obvious... you miss the silent lurkers who read content but never engage. But honestly, those weren't converting well anyway. The people who actively participate in conversations are the ones who'll actually respond to your outreach. You can do this manually by checking profiles one by one and filtering for your ideal customer, or if you're more technical, use automation tools like n8n, though that gets complex and expensive. There are also specialized software solutions designed for this, though I won't name specific tools here. The bottom line is this: active LinkedIn users are pure gold for cold email campaigns. By tapping into real-time social engagement instead of stale databases, you're reaching people who are already in the habit of responding and engaging online. Good luck guys !", "target": "positive"}

I used to think launch = just ship it and post on Product Hunt. I was wrong. Heres what actually moved the needle for them: Start telling the story weeks before. You dont need to build in public feature by feature, what worked best was sharing the big story early, giving people a reason to care before launch day. Line up distribution in advance. Get friends, colleagues, and even former classmates ready to upvote/share on Product Hunt. Reach out to people whove retweeted similar launches (tools like Apify can help scrape lists).

Not because they suddenly believed in us but because they didnt want to miss out on a deal their former partner was in.

Here is a piece of advice : Use it to integrate code and link between front and backend, do not expect it to build complex systems on it own. Treat it like a kid, its dumb, it needs to understand what you're trying to do in DETAILS, do not expect it to understand what you want to do. Be an engineer and expect the worse, if you faced a problem, DO NOT TELL IT TO RESOLVE IT, check the console, debug the code, send it to claude and tell it to fill it with console logs to debug it, and send it the resullts, take the solution and send it to the one building ur app. Again, AI doesnt think like a human, make the tasks easier to do, step by step, speak in a simple detailed language, and u need to explain what u want to do like u're explaining to a 7 year old. Edit : to clear up some misunderstandings, an app built with AI and a solo engineer/dev, isnt full production ready, u might be able to handle 1000 users that are in need of the app, in a specific small region of the world, which is my case, but not a global launch, it has many optimization and security issues that require a full dev team.

Ive tried e-commerce stores, Instagram theme pages, YouTube channels, affiliate marketing, CPA offers, reward sites. basically anything I could think of. Some of them made a couple thousand but most died out. When looking back now I realize the problem was always the same. I was chasing quick action instead of building something that actually mattered. Every project felt like a grind, Id launch a store, push ads, make a few sales and then watch it fade out. At some point I realized the obvious thing I had been ignoring that's if you dont provide real value, nothing else matters. You can run amazing ads or have a clever funnel but if the product itself isnt useful people wont stick around. And I was also skipping another basic step which was listening to customers. Not just mine but even my competitors. If people are complaining about something, thats literally a free roadmap for what to fix and I wasnt paying attention to that at all. Then by accident, I came across a YouTube video of someone building an iOS app. It reminded me that when I was 13 my dad had signed me up for programming classes and I actually built and published my first Android app back then. I had forgotten about it, but I remembered how much fun it was. So I decided to try again and this time it clicked instantly, I loved it. For once it didnt feel like a grind. Thats when I decided to stop chasing quick wins and build something I actually cared about. Ive always been into selfimprovement like reading, going to the gym, tracking progress. I like seeing progress in numbers and data. But I also noticed how messy most selfimprovement apps are. Notion is powerful but confusing and a lot of apps are old and outdated. So I took a couple of months and tried build something of maximum value while still keeping it MVP. The first version is a clean dashboard where you can \"install\" the tools you want to use. Habits, goals, journaling, tasks, detox tracker, countdowns, focus tracker. The part I cared most about was analytics and customization. Just because everyone's goals are different and analytics keeps you motivated and you can actually see the progress. Right now the app is live with a 7-day free trial so anyone can actually use it before deciding. It's called Strukt: Productivity hub but it's for Iphone only currently. Ive built in an easy way to send me feedback, and if something makes sense I can push updates fast, sometimes in less than 48 hours.

I've built over 8 projects before this. Some shipped, some didn't. Most flopped. At one point, I had started working on what eventually became a platform that helps founders find real, validated problems to build around. I had the idea, started scraping Reddit posts, G2 reviews, App Store feedback but I paused. Back then, I had a habit of stopping halfway. I'd build something, lose confidence when it didn't immediately take off, and jump to the next thing. That almost happened with this one too. At the time, I had a working prototype. I could generate startup ideas from Reddit threads, analyze SaaS gaps from reviews, turn App Store complaints into product opportunities, and identify what users hate about existing mobile apps across categories like period trackers, meal planners, and photo editors. I even shared a small post or two, got decent engagement, some messages, but nothing crazy. I almost gave up again. But something told me this time was different. So I kept going. I finished the MVP. I posted consistently. I asked for feedback. I improved it weekly based on what people actually wanted. Now it has over 6,000 users and has made $22,000 in revenue (5.6k in the past 2 months!!)

{"text": "I'm paralyzed by the marketing aspect of my business. Part of it is me. Part of it is my industry. I'm in the self-improvement space (coaching for procrastination, mental health, etc) which is a space saturated with low quality products. As someone trying to offer a high quality service, here is the issue as I see it. Effective growth happens through a complex process which is unique for each person, which means its complex to market. Ineffective growth is sold through simple solutions which apply to everyone at once, which makes them fit more easily into a traditional sales funnel. Ex; \"This 1 strategy will stop procrastination instantly\" VS. \"Procrastination is caused by many things and has many different solutions. I help you manage your expectations and find your blind spots.\" I feel stuck between demonstrating my value in a way that is too complex to hold attention and interest, and only being able to simplify my message by stripping away what makes my service effective  giving away my only real advantage by doing so. I thrive in long-winded discussions (podcasts)  but growing a business solely via podcast is obviously unfeasible. Im hoping for a budge in two ways: 1. Perspective Adjustment  snapping myself out of the snootiness, perfectionism, self-critical process that causes me dismiss 90% of my ideas and options for viable promotion. 2. Advice for marketing a complex service: I think my service is inherently complex and cant as easily fit into a typical sales funnel strategy.

{"text": "Ok so pricing is the mind game nobody talks about honestly... like everyone gives theoretical advice but here's what actually happened when I tested different prices for TuBoost.io (with real numbers and psychological tricks that worked) My pricing journey (with actual conversion data): Phase 1: $10 (the \"safe\" price) Conversion rate: 8% Monthly revenue: ~$50 Customer feedback: \"seems too cheap, is it legit?\" My mindset: scared of rejection, wanted everyone to afford it Phase 2: $50 (the \"ambitious\" price) Conversion rate: 0% Monthly revenue: $0 Customer feedback: crickets (nobody even tried it) My mindset: panic, immediately doubted everything Phase 3: $30 (the \"goldilocks\" price) Conversion rate: 6% Current monthly revenue: ~$770 Customer feedback: \"fair price for the value\" My mindset: finally found the sweet spot The psychology tricks that actually moved the needle: 1. Anchor with value, not features BEFORE: \"AI video processing for $30\" AFTER: \"Save 3 hours of editing for $30\" People buy outcomes, not technology 2. Compare to alternatives they already use \"Less than what you spend on Netflix, saves you 10+ hours monthly\" \"Cheaper than hiring an editor for ONE video\" Makes the price feel obvious instead of expensive 3. Remove the biggest objection upfront Added \"Cancel anytime, no questions asked\" Conversion jumped 40% immediately People need emotional permission to buy 4. Use precise numbers (psychological trick) $29.99 feels \"marketingy\" and fake $30 feels honest and confident Weird but precise pricing ($23, $37) can work for premium positioning 5. Payment psychology that matters \"Less than $1/day\" breaks down resistance Annual plans with 2 months free (creates urgency) Never say \"only $30\" (makes it sound small/cheap) The uncomfortable truths about pricing: Truth 1: Higher prices filter for better customers $10 customers complained about everything $30 customers give constructive feedback Price affects customer behavior, not just revenue Truth 2: Most people undercharge from fear, not strategy We're scared of hearing \"that's expensive\" But \"that's expensive\" just means they're not your customer The right customers don't negotiate on small amounts Truth 3: Value perception trumps actual value Position yourself as premium solution to specific problem Not cheap alternative to expensive thing \"Best video editor for creators\" vs \"affordable editing tool\" Specific tactics that work: The \"comparison anchor\" method: \"Professional editors charge $100/video\" \"This processes 20 videos for $30\" \"ROI obvious when you do the math\" The \"time value\" calculator: \"If your time is worth $20/hour\" \"And this saves 3 hours monthly\" \"It pays for itself in half a month\" The \"social proof\" pricing: \"39 other creators are already saving time\" \"Join the creators who value their time\" FOMO works if it's genuine Common pricing mistakes I made: Competing on price : Race to bottom, attracts wrong customers Explaining the price : If you have to justify it, it's wrong Changing prices randomly : Confuses positioning and brand Ignoring customer feedback : They tell you if it's right or wrong How to test pricing systematically: Start with value-based pricing (what outcome is worth to them?) A/B test 20% higher and 20% lower Track conversion AND customer quality metrics Ask customers \"what would be expensive for this?\" Adjust based on data, not feelings The mindset shift that changed everything: Stop thinking \"what can I charge?\" and start thinking \"what's this outcome worth to someone who has this problem?\" Questions to find your right price: What do customers spend on alternative solutions? How much time/money does your solution save them? What would they pay to avoid their current frustration? Are you attracting customers who value what you built? Real talk: pricing is 80% psychology, 20% math. Most founders get this backwards and optimize for conversion rate instead of customer quality. Anyone else have pricing breakthrough moments? The psychological aspect of this stuff is wild when you start paying attention to it. Also curious what pricing mistakes you've made because I guarantee I've made worse ones lol.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "1 year ago, I quit my job as a software engineer. 6 months ago, I started building a Reddit marketing tool to help brands find their first users on the platform. I've been dedicated to this for the past few months. It all started by chance. One day, I saw a post where a startup founder shared how they tried to promote their product on Reddit, but because they didn't understand the community culture, many of their posts were heavily downvoted and eventually deleted. It got me thinking: How many brands are wasting time and effort because they don't know the rules and culture of every sub? I want to help entrepreneurs get rid of this confusion for good. If you can find the communities that are already actively discussing topics related to your product and master the right marketing approach, your chances of success will increase dramatically. Here's what I'm building: a Reddit tool with an AI Matching feature. It will use AI to analyze your product information and keywords, then precisely match you with the most relevant subreddits. This ensures your content reaches the right people and prevents you from wasting effort in the wrong communities. To build this tool, I've analyzed over 100,000+ subreddits, 500,000+ Reddit posts, and 3,000,000+ comments. And it's worth noting that during my analysis, I noticed some subreddits have very strict written rules, but their posts and comments are managed more loosely. It's important to identify these situations. Here are the results so far: - 500+ visitors to my website - 300+ registered users - 100+ paying customers - $3,500+ in revenue last month While it's not life-changing yet, it feels amazing. It proves that if I provide real value, people will actually pay for what I've built. For anyone building a product and feeling like they're toiling in obscurity, my advice is this: If you can find a pain point that users are actively discussing, that's your opportunity. If you're also trying your hand at Reddit marketing, this tool might save you a ton of time and effort, and even provide you with a better strategy. If you'd like to check it out, my tool is called Leadmore AI. It already has a content publishing feature, and the features mentioned in this post will be live this week.

{"text": "Hey Solopreneurs, Running a one person business means juggling a lot, especially money. One thing that really helped me level up was focusing on building business credit early on. Why? It keeps your business finances separate from your personal ones, which protects your credit and makes taxes easier. Plus, banks and lenders look way more favorably on businesses with their own credit histories. That means better loan options, credit lines, and payment terms. Having solid business credit also boosts your credibility with vendors and partners, often getting you better deals and trust. And it gives you financial flexibility when things pop up unexpectedly or when you want to grow fast. Getting started is simple: a business credit card or small line of credit, using it responsibly, and paying on time. Over time, it builds a strong foundation that lets you focus on growing your solo venture without money stress. If you want to swap tips or hear what worked for me, lets chat.

Every day youll get a new workout for each category, so you never get stuck repeating the routine you have already done 20000 times. The idea came from my own frustration. I was tired of doing the same YouTube workouts. What I wanted was something simple: no overthinking, just open the app, pick a time, and follow along. So I built the app I wish I had years ago. Since I also do 3D animation, I created a robot coach who demonstrates all the exercises. He makes the workouts feel more fun and less serious, and hes also become my mascot for the project.

{"text": "Hi. Before answering with \"Ninite\" or \"Winstall\", this is not what I'm looking for. What I'm looking for is much more flexible and customizable. Here's what it must be able to do: Take any installer for a software I provide. Be able to copy a portable app to a desired directory. (And be able to create said directory if necessary) Be able to add or replace files after an install. This is, for example, to copy a backup of software settings to AppData or install plugins that does not come inherently with an app and does not necessarily have an installer. Be able to resume progress after a reboot if an app required it. As such, able to know when an app has finished installing and detect if its installer downloaded another installer such as an optional plugin for an app does not have in its installer but can fetch it for you or missing dependencies. A great example is any MS Visual C++ Redistributables) Ability to run all installers silently or verbose. (Optional) Ability to create a personalized .exe or .msi with all the required files inside. (Optional) However, it is required that, at least, it's able to create its own proprietary package format in one file. Having to install this app before all others is acceptable. The ability to add drivers install package is optional (since these might be more sensitive or more machine specific) Having a GUI and no scripting / programming knowledge is REQUIRED AND NON-NEGOTIABLE . It can be free (closed or open source) or paid. REASONING: A lot of people might say \"why not make an image of your OS install?\". That can work but they are inefficient space wise: they have the WHOLE OS and all the shebang along with it. On top of that, what if you want to change the version of Windows and fresh install it? Using the image will only re-install the same version of the OS. For most people, Ninite and Winstall will do the job but I find that, looking at both options, that there are missing a lot of apps I want installed, want finer control or are legacy apps not available for download anymore. Some are paid apps which might need me to enter the product key. So, they can't be included in Ninite or Winstall. My setup is particular as well: I have several dozens of apps and it take me DAYS to have everything back up and running after a Windows re-install. So, just me thinking about re-installing Windows is nightmarish. Just having to double-click a file and have them all installed in 30 minutes, including their most up-to-date backed up settings, would be AMAZING. Now, I know I might be pulling at straws here. There might not be such program floating around. That's why I'm willing to pay for it - if it exists. I'd really love if Reddit knows of such an app. I know it bears similarities to Ninite or Winstall but some kind of offline option with the possibility of other apps.

{"text": "As an ADHD person, I've been having a rough time following through on tasks - especially tasks that I really don't want to do (setting up my new healthcare, returning something to amazon, etc...) I hit my breaking point last week, and decided that it was time to make something to fix this. So I'm building a \"do\" assistant - Whenever AI. Here's how it works: 1. Enter a task 2. The assistant breaks it down into steps 3. For each step you get one-tap actions and the exact info you need to complete the step Basically, how can we make it so easy and frictionless to do a task you can't say no. For example, I need to Post Barstools to Facebook Marketplace Whenever breaks the task into steps: 1. Take photos, 2. Write Item Descriptions, 3. Set a price 4. Create listing Then, for each step it gives you everything you need to complete that task as easily as possible: 1. Take Photos -> One tap open camera button, guide on how to take the best FB marketplace pics.

{"text": "Last year, I started looking at failed product launches across Twitter, Product Hunt, and Reddit. I analyzed 1,000+ failed SaaS launches and interviewed 47 of their founders. The results were crazy to me. Only 12% failed due to technical issues or poor execution (pretty low with AI now). The overwhelming majority was that 73% failed because they built something nobody actually wanted. and also: 89% of these founders claimed they \"validated\" their idea before building. So what went wrong? Every single founder I spoke to followed the same \"SaaS Playbook\": surveys, landing pages, interviews/posts with people in their niche. They got encouraging responses, built the product, launched... and no one gave any shit. The problem isn't that validation doesn't work. The problem is that most validation methods are fundamentally flawed. When you ask someone \"would you pay $29/month for this productivity tool?\" in a survey, they're giving you a hypothetical answer. They want to be helpful, so they tell you what sounds reasonable. But real purchasing decisions don't happen in surveys. They happen when someone is frustrated enough with their current solution to actively search for alternatives. The founders who succeeded did something different. They didn't ask hypothetical questions they found people who were already complaining about existing solutions. One founder I interviewed built a project management tool after spending weeks in contractor Facebook groups where people constantly complained about existing software. Another created a scheduling app that fixed what users hated after documenting hundreds of negative reviews about calendar tools. They found real pain points FROM EXISTING products, not just imagined problems. The difference between a complaint and a survey response is everything. complaints are unfiltered, detailed, and come from people actually using the software that they pay for. They reveal specific frustrations, workflow breakdowns, and feature gaps. That's why I started collecting these complaints systematically. G2 negative reviews where people explain exactly why they switched platforms, Reddit threads where users detail their software frustrations, App Store feedback where people describe what made them delete apps. Here's the data if you want to check it out: link (if you are curious) Your next successful product isn't hiding in a useless brainstorming session or \"survey\" results from posts on different platforms. It's sitting in plain sight in every detailed complaint thread, frustrated review, and angry support ticket. Stop asking hypothetical questions.

{"text": "Hello everybody. I am quite excited to share one of the projects of mine that Ive been working on - https://secureledger.app/ . It is the quite typical finance manager app with a couple crucial differences - one of which is the maximum possible privacy of the users data. There are also few AI features for ease of use and deep data analysis. The project is free except for the AI-based features. Yet, when you create a new dashboard you are given 300 free tokens that should be plenty to see all the features available for free. With this project, I wanted to address a fundamental problem with personal finance apps - the requirement to trust companies with your most sensitive financial data. Most apps store your transaction details, spending patterns, and financial behavior in plaintext on their servers, creating privacy risks and attractive targets for data breaches and misuse of that data. My solution is a receipt processor and expense tracker built on zero-knowledge architecture. The core principle is simple: I cannot access your data even if I wanted to. Here's how it works technically: When you create a dashboard, you set a private password known only to you. This password generates an encryption key entirely within your browser using client-side cryptography. Your sensitive datastore names, prices, purchased items, spending patternsis encrypted in your browser before any transmission to my servers. What I store is encrypted data that appears as meaningless text without your password. The application handles both receipt scanning and manual entry. For receipt processing, I've implemented an isolated AI service that operates anonymously. Your browser requests a temporary token from the main application, then sends the receipt image directly to a separate AI service that has no knowledge of your identity or dashboard. The AI extracts the text and returns it to your browser, where it's encrypted before storage. The AI service never retains the image or extracted text. The dashboard provides comprehensive analytics through interactive charts that decrypt and process your data entirely in the browser. You can track spending patterns, monitor category breakdowns, and even calculate a personalized inflation rate based on your actual purchases. For deeper insights, there's an AI analysis feature that can answer questions like \"Where can I reduce spending?\" using your decrypted data processed anonymously. For shared finances, dashboard owners can generate revocable invite links, but shared users must receive the dashboard password to decrypt and view the data. This maintains the zero-knowledge principle even in collaborative scenarios. The architecture ensures that even in a complete server breach, your financial data remains secure and unreadable. I'm looking for feedback on the concept, user experience, and any concerns about the privacy model. The application is functional and I'm particularly interested in perspectives on whether this level of privacy is valuable enough to users to justify the additional complexity of password management.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "Hey there, young SaaS padawan. You want more clients? Of course you do. Everyone here does. Heres the blueprint I use to book a ton of calls from LinkedIn. First, forget about tools, imports, or offers for a second. What you need is a fully optimized profile. No excuses. If youre a woman, youll naturally get a slightly higher reply rate. Thats just how it is. An optimized profile means consistent activity on LinkedIn, a clear banner that shows what you do, a decent profile picture, a description that makes sense, an up-to-date experience and education section, and a clickable link in your bio that leads straight to a booking page or website. If youre still rocking an old profile with no picture, stop here. You wont get results. Once your profile is ready, move to step two: your offer. If your product is priced too low, think under $150 a month, youre wasting time. Outreach at that level is painful and rarely worth it. Aim for at least $200 or more per month unless youre targeting influencers for broader reach. Step three is defining your ICP. This part is critical. You can only send about 200 invites per week. If your targeting is off, youll waste your invites and never know if your offer works. Now, lets talk lead sourcing. You have two options. Option one, do what everyone does and pull the same leads from static databases like Apollo, enrich them with Dropcontact, and hit the same pool of prospects everyone else is spamming. Option two, play smarter and use dynamic data. These are what I call High Intent Leads, people showing real activity signals. Scrape event attendees, post likers, commenters, or people engaging with specific keywords. Then filter those signals down to your ICP. Once you have your dynamic list, youll need an automation tool to send messages. There are dozens out there, and some even combine sourcing and outreach. Do your research and pick what fits your workflow. Now, messaging. If you pitch in your first message, youre dead. If you include a note in your connection request, youre dead. Heres what actually works. Send a simple invite. If they dont accept the next day, engage with their content. Like their latest posts, leave a thoughtful comment, follow them. Get on their radar. Once they accept or after a few days of light engagement, send a message. Make it contextual. If you saw they joined an event, say something like, I noticed youre interested in this topic, would you be open to chatting about it? If you dont have context, keep it simple and conversational. The goal is just to get a reply. This is the foot-in-the-door approach. Once they respond and show interest, dont send a calendar link right away. Ask what time works best for them, then handle the booking yourself. Later, configure your calendar for automated SMS and email reminders to reduce no-shows. And thats it. The SaaS game is getting tougher, so youll need to be sharper than ever. Good luck out there.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "I spent 6 months surveying 500+ founders across startup communities (reddit, twitter, discord/slack communities, fb groups), and the results were brutal. Here's what I discovered: 87% admitted they built their product based on personal assumptions (what they thought was cool/useful), not actual market research. Even worse, 73% said they wished they had access to real user complaints to see what users would pay for before starting development. The problem isn't lack of ideas. The problem is founders are solving imaginary problems. Think about it lol. every successful SaaS solves a pain point people already experience. Slack didn't invent team communication problems. Notion didn't create the need for better documentation. They found existing frustrations and built solutions early on. There are 100s of competitors but they found out what users hate about existing solutions, and built on top of them to build a superior application. But here's where most founders mess up: they ask \"would you pay for this?\" instead of finding people who are already paying for broken alternatives. After talking to hundreds of entrepreneurs, I kept hearing the same story: \"I spent X number of months building something, launched it, and got 0 shits given. Turns out nobody actually had the problem I was trying to solve.\" This is why I started digging deeper into where real problems actually live. Not surveys or focus groups, but actual user complaints (negative reviews) on different platforms. I analyzed over 150k negative reviews from G2, scraped 50k frustrated App Store reviews, and crawled thousands of Reddit threads where people vent about broken tools. The patterns were eye-opening. People complain about the same software issues repeatedly across industries. They're actively discussing workarounds, paying for multiple tools to solve single problems, and begging for better alternatives in public forums. its actually nuts on how many ideas people miss. These aren't hypothetical problems, they're pretty much frustrations with clear market signals. People want these solutions and are WILLING to pay for it. The difference between successful and failed SaaS isn't the quality of execution. It's whether you're solving a problem that actually exists. if you want to check the data i've scraped and the analysis: Link . would love to hear your thoughts.

{"text": "I analyze pitches against patterns from millions of documented failures. Not generic advice - specific data on why your exact phrases kill deals. What you get: Death word analysis (phrases that predict rejection) Score across 5 dimensions (Clarity, Hook, Value, Believability, Memorability) Exactly what successful pitches in your space say instead No sugar coating - pure pattern matching How this works: Comment your pitch (2-3 sentences, what you tell potential clients/investors) I'll analyze it against failure patterns You get brutal truth in reply (publicly - keeping it transparent) Why I'm doing this: Beta testing PitchPyre before launch. System trained on 15+ years of pitch outcomes. Not AI hallucinations - actual correlation data. Recent example: Someone pitched \"revolutionary platform that transforms businesses\" - those three words appear in 73% of failed pitches but only 8% of successful ones. Replaced with \"I fix checkout abandonment in 48 hours\" - specific, measurable, valuable. First 10 real pitches get analyzed. No \"testing\" or \"just curious\" - post your actual pitch or move on. Your ego will hurt. Your conversion rate will improve. Drop your pitch below. Format: Who you help, what problem you solve, how you're different. Note: Analysis happens in comments for everyone to learn. No DMs. If you can't handle public feedback, don't post.

{"text": "My wife and I own a food manufacturing business, and although 99% of our business is distribution, we have a small retail shop in front of the production area to sell our products direct to consumer. Our plan was to scale back the distro and focus on retail, so we dumped a bunch of money into the shop, and then covid hit. So, our distro doubled during that time. It seems for the last few years more and more people have become the main character in their worlds, and it has become our duty to make every day a special occasion. The big problem we face is that no matter what we do, it doesnt live up to their expectations. Ill give an example. We have a regular customer who comes in and if were out of Product A., then she acts sad and says that was whole reason she came in. If were out of Product B.  same thing. It has gotten to the point where we tell her were out of something, so when she acts upset we say oh, actually! We DO have some!!. People come in, see our wall of products and ask what do you have special today?. Like, wtf do you mean? Youve never been here. We have 20 products out there. Our distro companies are the same. But thats a whole different story. It just seems like no matter what we do, no one is happy. We had a customer come in with his kid and ask us if we have chicken wings. Why would we sell chicken wings? Where would they have even gotten that idea? Then theyre mad we dont have chicken wings. Like, this really happened. Im so burnt out on people. Its starting to show. We debate just closing the doors to the public but we spent so much money building out the retail area. I dont know. Im mostly venting I guess.

{"text": "Created an account to ask this, as Im not sure how to proceed with the situation. We run a small seasonal business, and while Im not a fan of hiring friends, we hired a friend. He was a great fit for the job, seemingly had a great attitude and we made it clear that we prioritized the friendship, and if he ever wanted to step out because it was too much, just tell us and there would be no hard feelings. Lets call our friend James. He worked ran our kitchen. Hes in his 20s. James rarely showed up on time, maybe I can count on one hand him clocking in when his shift started. Typically 10 minutes late. I do all opening and closing duties for him, so all he has to do is show up to a fully stocked and ready to go kitchen, work his shift and go home. He gets an hour break daily, sometimes longer if its a hot day (2-3 hours). He works 5 days on 2 days off. When its busy I step in to help and only leave again when its slowed down and I confirm hes all good. The last few weeks James has been incredibly miserable. Constantly saying fuck this fuck me this is stupid in front of the other staff and in earshot of the customers. Other comments were made by him that I had to speak with him about last week, I tried to have a productive conversation about how these comments were rude and offensive and asked him if hed like to be done for the season, no hard feelings, if it was getting to be too much for him. I got a plethora of excuses for why he said what he said. And he didnt mean it. And that he will push through until the season is done (a couple more weeks) and he left. I didnt feel the conversation went poorly, but I also didnt feel it went well. I told him Im not a push through for work type of boss, if you need the time off you need the time off. But he said nothing. He came in for his next shift (late) and worked it until about 5 hours in, which is when he started making the comments above, to which I sent him home. I said okay I think you can go home for the day, you cant be speaking like that at work, we have talked about this He said okay and left. Came in the next day in a decent mood. All was fine. The day after is when shit hit the fan. Myself and the other owner had an engagement we had to be at, we would be gone for 3-4 hours at most, and I overstaffed with completely confident team members so there would be no reason to worry. He had fully trained help in the kitchen, as well as two other staff in the building. I let him know I just needed him until we got back, and then hed be free to have the rest of the day and he agreed that sounded good. When we came back to the premises, I was notified that he had walked out an hour previous, telling no one he was leaving. He just walked out. I messaged him and received no answer. My partner did the same, and didnt get an answer. I worked the remainder of the day. Next day he didnt show up for his shift, still no response when I inquired. He responded two hours later saying he was sore and wouldnt be coming in. I let him know I was disappointed he felt he couldnt communicate any of that with me and that I feel he showed how little respect he had for me and my partner. But to take care of himself and let me know how he gets on. He claims its not disrespectful to walk out and then not show up for a shift with zero communication. And that hes sorry he handled it the way he did, but he didnt disrespect us. Now Im feeling the friendship is strained, and quite honestly Im genuinely angry. Im not sure how to proceed. Is this him quitting? Does he expect to go on like nothing happened? He has yet to respond to any other messages from us. BUT I do know hes doing well because he has responded to mutual friends, as I was concerned about his mental health. Looking for any advice? Ive already taken responsibility for all of his upcoming shifts, because he hasnt responded to anything else. So technically Ive got it covered, even though its going to create 14-16 hour work days for me until end of season and put a strain on my other staff. Do we just pretend nothing happened and give him an ROE saying end of season? Or do I put down he quit and screw him out of any employment insurance opportunities. I dont feel right doing that, so I likely wont, but Im at a loss at what to do.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "started a medical clinic 4 years ago. We are currently making maybe 5k profit per month.operating revenue of about 40k a month but most of it goes toward survival. I'm so tired of not bringing home much money and constantly problem solving /putting out fires all day every day. Even after performing the job, we have to wrestle the money from insurance which makes this whole process soul churning. To give a deeper idea, we are seeing around 30 encounters a day and billing 1.5 mill yearly. National average collection is 30% of what is billed. Growing at about 6% monthly in number of patients but still I can't understand the math because if I did this for salary, I'd be taking home 400k $ at a minimum. We made 120k last year and I sank all of it for down-payment and financed the rest of a 1.2 million$ location at 5.75% before interest rates went up. I don't think we would've survived otherwise as rent for clinic space nowadays is like 12k$ /month.

{"text": "Hello everyone, Im writing this post on behalf of my mom and wanted to thank you in advance for taking the time to read and share any advice. We truly appreciate it. My mom is a small business owner in California. She works 7 days a week, 1012 hours a day, and recently received notice of an ADA lawsuit. As far as we know, it hasnt been officially filed yet because she hasnt been served, but she did receive a letter/email from a law group stating that a lawsuit has been initiated. The claims in the letter include: Parking slopes being too steep Inadequately marked accessible parking spaces Lack of accessible dining surfaces Dining surfaces without required clear ground space Transaction counter too high Floor mat not secured properly The letter also stated that these issues violated ADA and UCRA, and that they denied the plaintiff equal access. Most of these are relatively simple fixes that my mom is willing to address, except for the parking lot slope, which is the landlords responsibility. From what I can tell, this letter serves as both a lawsuit complaint and a solicitation from a defense firm. When I looked up the plaintiffs name, I found multiple articles showing that this person has filed over 500 similar lawsuits. My questions are: If my mom corrects the issues, does that remove the risk of the lawsuit moving forward? Does she need to hire an attorney to fight this, or is there a simpler/less expensive way to resolve it? We called the law group that sent the letter, but they asked for a lot of money up front, which my mom cannot afford. What are the realistic next steps?

Currently, I'll look at a client's website and trying to calculate how many hours it'll take to do what they need me to do, multiply that by my hourly and there is the project cost. But what if it takes longer because of unforeseen circumstances? And estimating the exact hours of a task is always a crap shoot before really getting into the weeds of the site set up or marketing needs. How do others handle quoting their services like this? I've read a lot about value-based pricing rather than hourly. Where you take into account the monetary value you're providing the client. So if 40 hours of my time on a website improves your lead conversion, which equates to another $200k in revenue for that client that year, I should charge $50k for that because I'm generating substantially more value for them with my time than a hourly rate of $100/hour (that's just a random example so you get the idea). My recent thinking has been to offer clients four options: Offer to bill hourly. Get paid for exactly the time I work. This is variable and the client could end up paying more than they want. This also requires diligent time/task tracking so the client knows they aren't getting screwed over. Project-based cost. This is a set price ahead of time, but is inflated by some percent to account for unknowns, delays, extra meetings, etc. The idea is to add enough buffer to ensure I don't get underpaid and the client at least knows the total ahead of time. Some sort of value-based pricing like I mentioned above. But this requires truly understanding the financial picture of the business and what the services are going to do for their bottom line (which may not always be possible). Offer a more risky outcome-based pricing, such as getting 20% of all sales from the first year after a new ecommerce website launches. This is the most risky for me, which would mean it's going to cost the company the most. But it's a delayed cost and if it works out they should still make money on the deal. I would love to hear thoughts on these ideas or other ideas/strategies people have used that seem to work well.", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "What started as convenience has turned into a system that drains money from every side: Restaurants get extorted with 1530% commissions per order . This forces them to either raise prices or bleed out slowly. Drivers are paid scraps . $11.77/hour before gas on average . Its poverty wages, subsidizing billion-dollar corporations. Customers (thats us) get gouged with hidden fees, inflated menus, bogus service charges. sometimes paying 30%+ more than the food is actually worth . The apps dont create value. They leech it. They take money out of Toronto restaurants, out of workers pockets, and out of your wallet (and funnel it straight to Silicon Valley). So I built something simple: SkipFees . Its a completely free, community-driven directory of Toronto restaurants that deliver themselves . No parasites, no inflated prices, no middleman. I've added a few restaurants manually to get things rolling, but this is first and foremost a community project: Find restaurants near you that deliver directly. Dont see your favorite? Add it in seconds. Every listing is one less order encouraging the exploitation. P.S. Its very simple right now (and might be buggy!), but Im actively working on making it better. Im just a university student who got fed up watching local restaurants and customers get squeezed by billion-dollar bloodsuckers. SkipFees is free, and open to everyone.

{"text": "Hey Folks Ive been flipping electronics on the side for a while, mostly electronics from Facebook Marketplace that I resell on eBay. Its decent side income, but the process was inefficient. Every time I saw a potential deal, I had to: Manually search the title on eBay Estimate the resale price Factor in shipping, eBay fees, and desired margin Do all the math to figure out what I could offer and still make a profit Too many tabs. Too many missed opportunities. So I built something better. Introducing Flipr Flipr Overview Image A Chrome extension that simplifies the decision-making process. Heres how it works: Browse Facebook Marketplace with Flipr extension active.

{"text": "It is always difficult to find and reach customers, so I thought why not build for an audience that is all in one place. I built a Micro SaaS specifically for a 12K member Subreddit - People were sharing certain information regularly in that subreddit, I simply took it and put it in a website in a directory format - which is secure, easy to search and filter. I got 600 sign ups with just 2 posts, ~130 people started creating content directly on my site, and I got 7 paying customers since I added monetization a couple of weeks ago. It could have been more, but I gave extended free trial for all existing users till Sept 1st. So, hoping they would convert from Sept. Just wanted to share this here like a playbook that maybe you can try as well: Two biggest problems - Finding an idea to build, & Marketing it. My advice - Choose a Subreddit with 10K to 30K members and build a product around it. Why? - because each subreddit is already a niche, and if it has at least 10K members then I would consider it validated - people have gathered there because of a problem - either they need information or a community support. How to start? - look at the subreddit communities that you are already a part of for personal interests, not for business purpose, and choose one. Since you would already have a good understanding of the problem/needs of that subreddit community, you can start helping them by providing valuable information and slowly mention your newsletter/directory, and build an audience. Then you can expand into discord/webapp/micro SaaS/mobile app etc. If you can build and own your audience, then you can think of hundred ways to monetize it. Here is the best part, all the information you need to start would already be present in that subreddit itself, you just have to curate, organize it, maybe add your perspective, and make it easier to read/search/filter. Also, all your 'target audience' are in one place, so you can do cold DMs to reach them for free. Imagine a 50% sign up rate from a ~20K member highly engaged community! (..of course it won't happen in one day). Here are some things you can target to get good results: The subreddit should be between 10K to 30K members (these smaller subreddits are more engaging, and are not heavily moderated, you can promote your links as long as you are sharing information or helping the community.) Choose a Sub which is Non-tech and B2C. The subreddits should not be related to 'money making'/'finance'/'business' etc., because it's too competitive and also they don't allow promotions or linking your product. Find such communities which are just regular people who came to discuss their common interests, talk about their issues, or maybe just for community support online because maybe they can't share this with anyone in their real life. (People say all the good ideas are already taken etc. but you would be amazed to see what kind of niches exist in Reddit, which are completely untapped! And am not even talking about NSFW category.) Think of this as a long-term project, don't rush in to promote your product. First establish foundation and trust, and REALLY help the people (I can't stress this enough) - Money will come eventually if you provide enough value over time, but don't focus on it. I built so many products but nothing worked. But then, I tried this approach and it is working for me so far.", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "Im working on a SaaS idea that Im pretty confident solves a real problemIve seen tons of people complain about it on Reddit and in Google reviews.

{"text": "Hello everybody, I've been developing a utility piece titled FlowTask, and I am completely torn about decisions now. The general concept is: Instead of spending hours coming up with systems (as in Trello, ClickUp, Notion), you just type one prompt  FlowTask generates a structured workspace with tasks, docs, deadlines in a snap. Example Write \"Plan a Black Friday sale\", You are given a plan deadline, checklist for marketing, and copy prompt samples. Write \"Research competitor pricing\", You receive a workspace for notes + tasks to accomplish in an organized manner. On top of everything else, I just made FlowBot: It is a context-sensitive AI residing within your workspace. Rather than canned responses, it reads what is already on the page and responds specifically. Example: Upload a contract, Click \"highlight risky clauses\", it highlights problems straight in the doc. Or: Ask it to \"summarize these meeting notes\", it condenses them into neat bullets in real time. Where Im stuck is this: Some folks show me this is a productivity game-changer, \"skip the setup, start executing.\" Others comment, \"All it does is what it does now.\" So let me ask in complete sincerity: Would you really use some such service as FlowTask in everyday life? If yes, whats the #1 use case where it saves you time? If no, whats missing or what would stop you? I do not wish to invest my time in developing something nobody cares about.

On paper, it looked solid enough. Customers were paying. Growth seemed possible. And the market was hot. But underneath the hood? It was a ticking time bomb. The company was burning $170,000 every month to keep the lights on. That meant for every $1 coming in, almost $3 were going out. Still, the investors told themselves: Growth will fix this. Just give it time. At first, churn was under control. Customers were sticking around. But then, net retention slipped from over 100% down to around 85%. Instead of asking Why are people leaving? Whats broken in our product? the leadership blamed the customers. And instead of cutting burn, laying people off, slashing spend, forcing a reset they said: Well grow our way out of this. It only got worse. One co founder left. That should have been a wake up call. A chance to reset. But nothing changed. With cash dwindling, they did a least worst merger with another struggling SaaS, hoping two weak companies could magically become one strong one. You can guess how that ended. Equity holders? Wiped out. The company? Gone. The Lesson Revenue isnt enough. $60k/month looks great on a tweet, but if your burn is triple that, youre dead man walking. Retention is oxygen.

A dominant theme is the frustration with ineffective cold outreach and the need for more targeted, personalized, and automated marketing strategies. Many founders also struggle to identify genuine market problems beyond their own developer-centric issues, leading to product saturation and a lack of clear differentiation. Furthermore, there's a recognized need for tools that streamline internal business operations, such as tracking software subscriptions and managing user feedback, to reduce costs and improve product-market fit. 1. Top 5 User-Stated Pain Points Ineffective & Time-Consuming Cold Outreach: Founders perceive cold emails and DMs as a \"huge time sink\" with low reply rates, and struggle with the effort required for genuine personalization at scale. Quote: \"cold outreach feels like a huge time sink. Some say writing the first message takes forever, others say getting replies is the real struggle.\" Lack of Market Insight & Product Validation: Many \"indie hackers\" build products based on their own problems or without deep industry experience, leading to generic \"dev tools\" and a struggle to find genuine, paying customers. Traditional validation methods like landing pages are seen as insufficient. Quote: \"a lot of indie hackers / build-in-public folk often haven't had actual deep industry experience in anything, they aren't exposed to any vertical-specific pain points.\" Difficulty Acquiring First Customers & Achieving Distribution: Technical founders often excel at building but significantly underestimate the \"grind\" of marketing and distribution, struggling to get their product in front of the right audience. Quote: \"It doesn't matter how good your code is if you can't distribute it or sell it.\" Information Overload and Disorganized Data: Users, especially solo founders and small businesses, are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information (emails, social DMs, internal documents) and struggle to filter what's truly necessary. Quote: \"we are building LM-powered software that will help people with information overload and presents the necessary information only like in emails, social DMs.\" Inefficient Management of Software Subscriptions: Companies (from small teams to agencies) waste money on forgotten or unused software subscriptions and struggle with manual tracking methods like spreadsheets. Quote: \"Im thinking of building a lightweight app for teams/companies that subscribe to a lot of software and struggle to keep track of whats still in use.\" 2. Validated Product & Service Opportunities AI-Powered Outreach & Lead Generation Platform The Problem: Founders waste significant time and effort on cold outreach (emails, LinkedIn DMs) that often results in low reply rates and difficulty personalizing at scale. The Opportunity: A SaaS platform that automates the identification of high-intent leads from social media (e.g., Reddit, LinkedIn), crafts personalized messages, and facilitates multi-channel outreach campaigns. Key Features / Deliverables: Keyword-based social listening (Reddit, LinkedIn), AI-generated personalized message drafts, automated DM/email sequencing, lead scoring/prioritization, integration with CRM/outreach tools. Evidence from Data: Directly addresses \"frustrating part of sending cold emails or DMs,\" \"personalization at scale,\" and \"getting any reply at all.\" Mentions Reddit Notifier, F5Bot, and SourceGeek as existing/similar concepts. Market Problem Discovery & Validation Toolkit/Service The Problem: Technical founders often build solutions without deeply understanding specific market pain points beyond their own developer challenges, leading to products with low demand or high competition. The Opportunity: A service or tool that helps founders systematically identify underserved market niches, extract validated pain points from community discussions, and conduct effective demand validation before extensive development. Key Features / Deliverables: Reddit/community scraping for pain points, structured survey/interview templates for validation, \"fake checkout\" or commitment-based validation methods, market size estimations (TAM, SAM, SOM), ICP definition guidance. Evidence from Data: \"Im confused about what kind of startup to build  where do people actually find real problems to solve?\", \"Landing pages don't validate ideas. They validate your marketing copy,\" \"Reddit Idea Scraper\" (a user-built tool) and explicit requests for market research. Collaborative SaaS Subscription Optimization Platform The Problem: Companies, especially small to mid-sized teams, struggle to keep track of their numerous software subscriptions, leading to wasted expenditure on unused tools and inefficient budget management. The Opportunity: A lightweight, collaborative SaaS application that centralizes all company subscriptions, allows employees to mark active usage, provides renewal reminders, and suggests cost-saving opportunities. Key Features / Deliverables: Centralized dashboard for all subscriptions, employee-driven usage status updates, automated renewal alerts, spending analytics by category, AI-powered cancellation/optimization suggestions. Evidence from Data: \"Would your company use a simple app to track software subscriptions?\", \"spending over $200 a month on subscriptions I barely used,\" and a direct mention of \"SubBuddy\" as a solution built to address this. 3. Target Audience Profile The primary target audience consists of solo founders, indie hackers, and small to medium-sized business (SMB) owners and managers , particularly those with a technical background (developers, engineers) who are building or running SaaS products. Likely Job Roles: Software developers turned founders, startup CEOs, marketing leads in small teams, sales development representatives (SDRs), recruiters, and operational managers. Tools They Currently Use: Spreadsheets, Notion, Discord, LinkedIn, Product Hunt, GitHub, generic AI content tools (ChatGPT), Apollo, existing outreach tools (e.g., SourceGeek), and basic monitoring tools. Many are also familiar with modern tech stacks like Next.js, Supabase, Stripe. Primary Goals: Increase revenue, acquire first customers, validate product ideas quickly, reduce marketing costs, optimize operational efficiency, avoid \"building in a vacuum,\" and manage financial outflow effectively. 4. Potential Monetization Models AI-Powered Outreach & Lead Generation Platform: Subscription (tiered based on lead volume, features, or team size), Freemium (basic features free, advanced paid), Pay-per-lead, Enterprise licensing. Market Problem Discovery & Validation Toolkit/Service: Subscription (tiered for tool access), Fixed-Price Service (for custom research reports or validation sprints), One-time License (for template libraries or specific datasets), Consulting packages. Collaborative SaaS Subscription Optimization Platform: Subscription (tiered by number of users or tracked subscriptions), Freemium (limited tracking for free), Enterprise plans with advanced integrations. 5. Voice of the Customer & Market Signals Keywords & Jargon: indie hacker, build-in-public, dev tools, SaaS, MRR, MVP, Product Hunt, cold outreach, DMs, personalization at scale, churn, retention, product-market fit, bootstrapped, solo founder, AI, LLM, vibe coding, distribution, moat, GTM, TAM, SAM, SOM, ICP, ATS, freemium, LTDs, Appsumo, webhooks, analytics, database latency, UI/UX, conversion funnel, NPI/NDA, SDR, cross-promotion, lead generation, API, boilerplate, no-code, micro-SaaS.

Quantified Demand Signals: Numerous threads and comments on the frustration and low success rates of cold outreach, indicating a persistent, unsolved problem (\"Comments (28)\" on \"Most frustrating part...\"). High engagement on posts about achieving early MRR, even small amounts like $608, showing strong interest in growth strategies and validation (\"Comments (57)\" on \"$608 MRR\"). A post specifically offering to \"research leads and fine-tune your marketing\" received \"Comments (78),\" demonstrating a clear demand for lead generation and marketing support. Mentions of tools like \"Reddit Notifier\" and a \"Reddit Idea Scraper\" built by users underscore the perceived value in leveraging community data for market insights. The \"SubBuddy\" app, built to solve a personal pain of wasting \"$200/mo on forgotten subscriptions,\" highlights a relatable and quantifiable financial problem. The \"AI Sales Rep\" SaaS, Humen, achieving \"$900 revenue 30-day span\" and a \"waitlist of 150 users\" in a short time demonstrates demand for AI-driven sales automation. Discussion around \"distribution is the only moat left\" with \"Comments (49)\" reflects a widespread concern about competitive advantage in a crowded market. I just want to see if this is somewhat near accurate? are you really facing these problems? and if you like it, would you like it to see for other subs, as reddit posts, or a newsletter maybe?", "target": "negative"}

{"text": "There is one thing in automation that is rarely discussed, when AI can do everything quickly and efficiently, will we stop thinking? For example: the CV screening process in the Alurai l tool, there you can sort, m based on the CV, as HR will you lose the 'feel' or intuition in finding the diamond in the rough? The candidate may not fit the machine's criteria, but has great potential. Or in terms of market research, if AI analyzes raw data, will we lose the opportunity to understand the nuances of the story behind it? Is that true: - At what point does it automatically backfire and cause us to lose our human touch and creativity? - How to balance between AI speed and human institutions? - Have you ever had an experience where automation actually made you feel like you were being controlled by a machine?", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "I've been running FanCircles.com for the past eight years. It's a specialist SaaS product that costs around $60,000 per year. It's aimed at music artists and celebrities who have large audiences. For example, a music artist may use this if they're already playing 2,000 people per night. In those situations, we've consistently earned music artists $100,000 per 1,000 fans per year. The problem is the addressable market is much larger than this very difficult-to-reach niche. Don't get me wrong, we have over 100 creators already signed up. However, it's not been my most successful company. For example, my last company Awin.com was sold with a turnover of $150 million. In January this year, we began building what I thought was going to be a 2-3 month project. We call it FanCircles PushPass. Essentially, it's a way to push mobile notifications without the use or need of an app. It's priced at $24.99 a month, and I call it the \"MailChimp of notifications\" - it's a mass-market product. It took longer than 3 months. We're now 8 months later, and we're a week or so away from launch. It not only serves every size of music artist but also influences YouTubers and the whole creator economy, providing them with a way to reach their audience directly while collecting data (including email and location). Notifications can be pushed to their followers after a simple click or scan of a QR code. These notifications can either be simple messages or messages with links to anywhere. So for our YouTuber, it could be a message saying \"Hey, I've posted a new video\" or \"Hey, I have a 10% discount in my store right now. Click here\". For a music artist, it could be \"Listen to my new album on Spotify\" with a link to Spotify. With our 8-year history, I've got a massive database of artists and influences who didn't fit our $60,000 superfan app. And with my affiliate marketing history, the key behind this is a 30% ongoing lifetime commission for every new subscriber referred. I think for any SaaS model, affiliate marketing needs to be built into the P&L. And that's always been my aim from day one. The creator economy is huge, of course, and I want to take advantage of using YouTubers, TikTokkers, and Instagram influencers to promote the product, but it has to be worthwhile to them. And so the 30% lifetime commission is key to building lifetime partnerships. I'm very excited about getting this product launched - there's so much effort being put into it, and with a team of 12 people, we're ready to go. Wish me luck!", "target": "positive"}
{"text": "Building voice agents is easier than ever. There are plenty of no code tools that help you get something up in just a few minutes. The real challenge is making an agent that can survive all the edge cases that show up in real conversations. And thats before you even get into latency, model choice, and scaling to thousands of calls. When we first started building voice agents, this became painfully obvious - so much that we started building quite a lot of observability tooling around our own agents. It got to a point where we realized that making voice agents reliable might be a more interesting problem then building the voice agents themselves. My cofounder and I set on this journey last year - since then weve been through the YC winter batch, had countless sleepless nights building product, handled over 10M+ minutes in audio, and helped several voice AI teams fix the weak spots in their agents. We've built three core features that cover the development cycle of a voice agent - we let voice builders monitor live calls through integrations with all the popular voice agent platforms, catch failures as they happen through custom and pre-built evaluations, and then turn those failures into repeatable tests by simulating real phone calls with customers. That loop helps teams spot issues early, fix them fast, and keep agents from breaking in production. The lesson for us has been that sometimes the side problem - the tooling you build just to survive - turns out to be the bigger opportunity. We're live on Product Hunt today ( https://www.producthunt.com/products/roark ) - would love to get any feedback on our launch page or here in the comments. Have you built voice agents before? How did it go? Did your agent ever make it to production?", "target": "positive"}

{"text": "I recently realized my mission. I figured out what I love most. It was when I was watching a video about time of negative. I was more excited than hearing about someone's exit, and the thrill might have been even more intense than when I have my own exit. I realized it along with another video I experienced at that time - a video about how the unified field theory of gravity might be completed. At that moment, I realized what I want is to see \"the edge of the universe.\" Gravity distorts space, and observing time might finally bring it into a realm we can control. Then, maybe, just maybe, we could experience leaving our galaxy and traveling to another universe within our generation? You might know this, but the Earth-made object farthest from Earth is Voyager 1. But it hasn't even left the solar system yet. The thought of surpassing that - my heart races just writing this. Of course, when I told my girlfriend about this, she thought I was absolutely crazy lol. Some of you here probably think the same. But I'm convinced this future will come someday, and I'll work to bring it within my generation. That's why I want to focus the ultimate goal of all my business capabilities on helping with that. After taking care of myself, I'll help maintain Earth as our cradle and then help those who can work on this. Sadly, I'm not that smart, but I can still help them. That's my story.

{"text": "Hi mates, I am a 30~ish Male trying to go solo for the first time after being employed at big companies. I am currently working after daily work routine, on a couple of products, trying to resolve some problems I am aware of on the first one, and help a niche I love to expand their knowledge. 1st one is going fine, even if the product seems to be much difficult to develop than the idea I had of, so I am trying to cut features for future development, if ther product goes well, meanwhile the 2nd one is just a POC right now. My question is: how do I \"promote\" my first product? I mean I know the audience, it's a difficult one but still manageable since I may have contact to bypass some procedures, and I am sure my product will impact the life of lots of people, since it first solve a problem myself and my family do have most of the time. Other than this way? Which requires time and probably me leaving my current job, what can I do? Asking on reddit if it could work (for now it's a very country specific, because it should be a way to bypass our slow burocracy) Should I publish a landing page first? What can I do on the landing page or what can I explain without exploiting my idea to others, while receiving feedbacks? Is it useful to do a landing page first eventually before landing the MVP?

{"text": "As small business owners, many of us know the feeling: you build a great business, but you feel completely invisible. Often, the first thought is paid ads, but that quickly turns into a costly price war with the giantsa dead end. The second path is SEO, with the hope of outranking the market leaders for broad keywords. Unfortunately, both of these paths are the wrong battle . Instead of fighting for expensive, broad traffic, the key is to target the customers who are already at the finish line, wallet in hand. Heres the playbook on how to 'steal' them from the competition. Here are 3 simple plays: 1. The \"Us vs. Them\" Page ([Your Brand/Product] vs [Competitor]) Customers searching for this are ready to buy. Create an honest comparison page with a feature or service table. Don't just trash your competitionsimply show where you are the better choice (price, quality, location, customer service). 2. The \"Alternative to...\" Page (alternative to [Competitor]) You're capturing people who are actively dissatisfied with the market leader. Create a page that focuses on their pain points and shows how your business solves them. 3. The \"Best for...\" Page (best [product/service] for [niche]) This is the key to success for SMEs. Instead of fighting for broad keywords, dominate your niche. For example: Local Services: Instead of fighting for \"cleaning company,\" dominate \"office cleaning company in Boston.\" E-commerce: Instead of \"running shoes,\" target \"lightweight running shoes for pavement.\" Professionals: Instead of \"lawyer,\" try \"estate planning lawyer in Chicago.\" Position yourself as a specialist for a specific group, and you'll win their trust. 4. So, what's next? (Seriously, do SEO ) In small teams, there's often no time for this, but warring over paid positions in Google Ads is probably an even worse tactic. Besides, there are no excuses these days. If you don't want to hire an agency and don't have much time, there are tons of tools that let you get really good results with a very low investment of time and money. You basically only need a three-app stack. For mapping out user questions, use AnswerThePublic . Next, for the actual content creation, use tools like Verbite to generate solid, ready-to-publish drafts from your keywords. Finally, to monitor your results and your site's technical health, hook up the free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools .This stack lets you cover the key bases by investing about 1.5 hours a week, and month over month, you'll build more authority and gain more organic traffic. TL;DR: Stop fighting giants for broad keywords. Instead, \"steal\" high-intent traffic by creating 3 types of pages: [You] vs [Competitor] , [Competitor] Alternative , and Best [Product/Service] for [Niche] . Once you have these pages, continue your SEO efforts. Don't have time? Use simple tools for research and quick content creation. Month after month, you'll gain more and more traffic. What's the most effective (and maybe underrated) growth tactic you've found for your business? Let's share some knowledge.", "target": "positive"}

It felt like progress but really, I was just paying for a very expensive hobby. Thats when it hit me:  Validate your idea with cash, not compliments. Because: Compliments dont pay your server bills. Compliments dont prove demand. Compliments dont save you when things get hard. Cash does. Thats why I started thinking in terms of Funding-Market Fit :  Product-Market Fit gets you users. Funding-Market Fit gets you survival.  Its proof your product deserves capital  not just code.  Until you hit it, your company is just paperwork. Heres what it looks like in practice: 1 Build an MVP. 2 Market it before launch (Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn are free). 3 Get paying users  even if its 100, even if its ugly. 4 Only then, register the company or think about raising. Because at the end of the day: Compliments are free. Cash isnt. Thats Funding-Market Fit.  So if youre building, dont just chase users. Validate your idea with cash, not claps. Because Product-Market Fit gets you traction. Funding-Market Fit gets you survival.  Now tell me  did you register your startup before your first rupee of revenue?
