    "content": "Our car, which I share with my wife, is new enough that it has Bluetooth to connect to the audio system, steering wheel controls, etc. but old enough that it only allows a single device to be stored in its memory. It's impractical to delete and store a new device every time we swap over between the two of us so our solution has been that my wife has the Bluetooth slot while I have a Bluetooth adapter that transmits to an FM channel that I use when I am driving. This is a suboptimal solution because the audio quality is bad, there is regularly interference from random radio stations on long journeys, and I can't use the steering wheel controls to answer calls, change tracks, etc. What I am looking for is a Bluetooth bridge device. Something that stays connected to the car, and which we both can pair to easily. Something that would relay the audio from our phone to the car and signals from the steering wheel controls to our phones. But it seems like a really niche thing. Do you think it might exist? Looking around I can find plenty of Bluetooth FM transmitter devices, or devices that operate either on TX or RX mode, but nothing that fills this two way passthrough function that I want. I should add that I'm not looking to have both our phones connected at the same time necessarily. Just something that is easy to pair with. It may be that we could find something that we can both connect to and then easily flip between which device is connected to the car, a bit like an HDMI switch. Any ideas?"

    "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Doesthisexist/comments/1mnclxm/silent_plug_in_timer_switch_with_simple_interface/",
    "content": "I'm in the UK. I'm looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up. There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they'd be complicated to use - I'd be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I'd forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made. Something like this would be pretty much perfect: https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr# - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there's no \"hidden state\" - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don't have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don't really want next to my bed. (I don't mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don't want a constant noise) I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn't change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want. Something like this https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3 looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote \" It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all \" and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don't have full words on them. I have no idea what \"CD\" means in that context. Another reviewer said \" I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc. \" It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn't be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep. I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there's a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it. Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket."

All of the the trackers and tag systems seem to be built around bluetooth and phone apps as the anchor. They're more geared towards finding something after it's allowed to separate in the first place; they don't immediately notify you within seconds of separation from the phone.

Dishware like bowls, small plates, large plates, but with an enclosed kitchen scale that can track how much food is in or on this dish and then how much was consumed. I'm monitoring calories right now for weight loss and health related reasons, and I'm finding it really frustrating to have to spend a lot of time guesstimating the exact calories consumed from a meal when I inevitably am unable to finish the meal. I know I could use a standard kitchen scale but I find eating off of one to be kind of annoying and if I weigh my food, remove it to eat it and the try and weigh it after the scale has timed out. I know I can also just write all the measurements down but why do extra work when a simpler solution could exist. My picture of this in my mind would be like a plastic bowl shaped shell with a scale in the base of the bowl, with either a screen on the side of the bowl to display weight or an app that can link to it to track the measurements. I dont think it would need to be dishwasher safe and likely wouldn't be microwave safe. It could come in a few different sizes and potentially in different dishware styles as mentioned before like plates and cups. Does this exist?"

    "content": "Hey everyone, I just finished building an app called HUE and Id love for you to check it out! What is it? HUE is a dating & friendship app built around culture. Instead of swiping endlessly on people with no context, HUE helps you meet, date, and make friends with others who share (or are curious about) your cultural background. You can connect with people from 20+ different ethnicities, explore prompts that highlight identity & interests, and join group chats to build real communities. Why did I build this? As a Nigerian American in the diaspora, Ive always loved Nigerian culture - Afrobeats, Nollywood, and everything in between - but I realized I didnt have a big enough community around me to share that love with. That gap inspired me to create HUE. I wanted a space where people could celebrate who they are, meet others who share their interests, and form relationships rooted in authenticity. Why HUE is different: Culture-first profiles (show who you are & where youre from) Meet people for friendship, dating, or networking Group chats to easily form communities with the people youve connected with Built-in icebreakers so conversations flow naturally Download link (iOS):  HUE on the App Store This is still early, so any feedback is super appreciated.

Heres where things are right now  8,367 active users  742 paying customers  $6,761 in revenue  33,000 visitors and 62,000 page views on the site I spent nothing on ads. All the growth came from Reddit, a couple of posts going semi-viral, and people sharing it around. At one point it even got picked up by 3 Telegram channels with over 2M subscribers , which brought a huge wave of new users. Some takeaways so far  Free plan matters more than you think. People want to try without limits before committing.  Subscriptions are a dealbreaker for something like wallpapers. One-time payment works much better.  Distribution beats everything. You can have the nicest product but unless you share it in the right spots, no one finds it. This is still very early but Im curious how far I can push it.

And I've just got the collaboration feature with live updates done, so you can now store and share everything with your friends too! So you can use it as a shared information hub to store Tweets, youtube videos, websites, Instagram posts, tiktoks, blogs etc, to plan together for a trip or just to keep content organised together across platforms. Again, free to use, and if interested, here's a demo on how the collaboration feature works, and here's the App Store , Play Store and web app links too if you want to check it out!"

    "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mysjix/after_20_years_as_a_developer_heres_what_ai/",
    "content": "Ive been coding for about 20 years, and for the past year Ive been building most of my projects with AI. Honestly, AI has given me a massive productivity boost, taught me tons of new things, and yeah sometimes its been a real headache too  I thought Id share some lessons from my own experience. Maybe theyll save you some time (and stress) if youre starting to build with AI.  Early Lessons Dont ask for too much at once. One of my biggest mistakes: dumping a giant list of tasks into a single prompt. The output is usually messy and inconsistent. Break it down into small steps and validate each one. You still have to lead. AI is creative, but youre the developer. Use your experience to guide the direction. Ask for a spec first. Instead of just code it, I often start by having AI write a short feature spec. Saves a lot of mistakes later.  Code & File Management The same file in multiple windows = can be painful. Ive lost hours because I had the same file open in different editors, restored something, and overwrote changes. Commit and push often. Watch for giant files. AI loves to dump everything into one 2000+ line file. Every now and then, tell it to split things up, create new classes in new files and keep responsibilities small. Use variables for names/domains. If you hardcode your app name or domain everywhere, youll regret it when you need to change them. Put them in a config from the start.  Working with Chats Going back to old chats is risky. If you reopen a conversation from a few days ago and add new requests, sometimes it wipes out the context (or overwrites everything done since then). For new topics, start a new chat. Long chats get sluggish. As threads grow, responses slow down and errors creep in. I ask for a quick summary of changes so far, copy that, and continue fresh in a new chat. Much faster. Try different models. Sometimes one model stalls on a problem, and another handles it instantly. Dont lock yourself to a single tool.  Safety & Databases Never just run it. A careless SQL command can accidentally delete all your data. Always review before execution. Show AI your DB schema. Download your structure and let AI suggest improvements or highlight redundant tables. Sometimes I even paste a single tables CREATE statement at the bottom of my prompt as a little P.S. , surprisingly effective. Backups are life-saving. Regular backups saved me more than once. Code goes to GitHub; DB I back up with my own scripts or manual exports. Ask for security/optimization checks. Every so often, Ill say do a quick security + performance review. Its caught things I missed.  When Youre Stuck When I hit a wall, Ill ask AI to list possible steps. I dont just follow blindly, but it gives me a clear map to make the final call myself. And if things really start going sideways, dont wait too long, restart from scratch, get the small steps right first, and then move forward.  Wrap-up For me, AI has been the biggest accelerator Ive seen in 20 years of development. But its also something you need to handle carefully. I like to think of it as a super-fast medior developer : insanely productive, but if you dont keep an eye on it, it can still cause problems  Curious what others have learned too :) EDIT  A couple more things I forgot earlier:  If Im starting a bigger project , I sometimes kick it off with a system like Lovable, Rork, or Bolt to get the structure in place, then continue on GitHub with Cursor AI. This workflow has worked well for me so far , less cost, faster iteration, and minimal setup.  Sometimes I even ask AI : If I had to make you redo what you just did, what exact prompt would you want from me? Then I restart fresh with that   In Cursor I also upload extra context when needed , a screenshot, a code snippet, or even a JSON file. It really helps guide the AI and speeds things up. And if something still cant be solved in Cursor, I restart in Max Mode. It often produces smarter and more comprehensive solutions. Then of course I switch back to Auto Mode so I dont burn through all my tokens  Every now and then I ask the AI to  explain the whole system to me from scratch . It works as a memory refresh both for myself and for the AI. I sometimes copy-paste this summary at the beginning of new chats and continue from there.  One of the most effective ways to spot errors and keep track of the system is simple console log tracking . Just copy-paste the errors you see into the chat , even without extra explanation, AI understands and immediately starts working on a fix."

    "content": "Hey folks, I launched a simple receipt scanning app called Receipto back in May  it was a chill weekend build, meant to work completely offline. No cloud, no fancy AI, just scan and organize receipts locally. I honestly forgot about it for a few months while focusing on another project. A while ago, I posted about Receipto here on Reddit, even though the app wasnt in the best shape back then. But I got some super helpful and constructive feedback from the community, which motivated me to improve it and push a much better version. Fast forward to last week: I won a free promo spot on Indie App Santa (shoutout to them), and as I was prepping for the launch, I dropped the price to free for a few hours. Somehow, AppRaven (and maybe AppAdvice, too?) picked it up. In just 3 days , Receipto hit 19,000 downloads , mostly from Asia. The promo ended, the price went back up, and people actually started subscribing. It made $275 , which is more than what my main app did recently  That gave me the push to properly update it  I added AI-powered scanning (OpenAI & Gemini), optional cloud sync, export/import, recurring transactions, and fixed a bunch of bugs. If youre building something and feel its not perfect yet  just ship it. Talk about it. Reddit helped me a lot.

    "content": "Built this because my 11yo kid was missing effective ways to practise for her exams. I made her flashcards and quizzes by hand like it was 1995. She sure learnt that way too, but that got me thinking that not every kid have parent with that much free time on their hands. So I started building what I wished existed: kid takes picture of geology notes about plate margins, gets immediate practise that expose gaps in understanding. The photo constraint isn't just better UX, it's the only way to get usable output from that age group. They don't understand prompting. They'd type \"make quiz plz\" and get confused when it asks for context. So point phone, get quiz. The app takes 44 steps (AI prompting, context explanation, output formatting) and makes it one step (point camera). Consistent format, calibrated difficulty, no hallucinated facts. Kids 10-15 get the worst deal in edtech, even when this is the age when learning habits actually form. They are too advanced for baby apps, too young for adult tools. They get gamification theater instead: points, streaks, engagement mechanics that feel good but teach nothing. I stripped all that out. Photo determines content, AI determines difficulty, testing reveals gaps. No escape routes. Also, no ads, no trackers, no data selling. Photos stay on device. Making money from subscriptions, not from kids. Lexie is available on iOS lexielearn.com/app if you or your kids or your friends kids wanna test it out. Would really appreciate the feedback!"

    "content": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My names Rob & I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts. A couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day. I started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently. First off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS \"guru\" preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different. My secrets to a successful launch day: Building in Stealth: I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready. Posted screenshots asking \"who wants to try this?\" - no product links DMed interested people to join private beta Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better Built hype so launch day went that much better Launch Day Momentum: When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD. Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials  50,000 views Screenshot PostHog analytics  20,000 views Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard  10,000 views Every win becomes content that drives more wins Why Photos Matter: Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples attention. People root for underdogs (probably you) Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era) The Numbers Game: 70 free trials in 24 hours 50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%) 200,000+ views on X in 24hrs 95% of traffic from organic X posts Over 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, Im at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending. Ask me anything about: Failing 5 times and what I learned Building in \"stealth\" while still posting publicly Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta Launch day execution Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else Goal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year. After 5 failures, it finally feels possible. Happy to share specific tactics, screenshots, or just commiserate about the SaaS grind :) Let's gooo!

    "content": "A good friend of mine who's been in B2B sales for over 20 years recently shared something with me that completely shifted how I see prospecting and outreach. He didnt get a reply. He didnt have a meeting booked. There was no introduction or referral. Just a single like from a prospect on one of his LinkedIn posts. That was it. From that tiny moment of engagement, one that most salespeople would ignore, he ended up closing a $72,000 deal. What struck me wasnt just the outcome, but the way he explained the process. Hes no longer chasing people with cold DMs or relying on generic filters to build lists. Instead, hes paying attention to what he calls dynamic social signals. Little behaviors that indicate interest, curiosity, or intent, even if theyre subtle. He looks for signs like someone viewing his LinkedIn profile. Liking a competitors post. Following someone in his space. Commenting on a post related to the problem his product solves. Attending an event. Engaging in a niche discussion. To most people, those dont feel like leads. But to him, theyre the start of a conversation. When someone interacts with something even loosely related to his offer, he uses that as context to send a thoughtful message. Not a pitch. Not an automated sequence. Just a relevant piece of content, a short insight, or a question tailored to what the prospect showed interest in. He told me about a VP who viewed his profile after reading a post about ROI in telecom. Instead of pitching right away, he connected with that person and then 3 days later dropped a short message with a case study on how his product increased ROI for a similar client. The VP replied the same day. In another case, a director liked a post by an influencer talking about a problem his product solves. He followed up with a simple value-first message offering help, no strings attached. That turned into a call the same week. This method gives him four times more replies, four times more acceptance, and over 90 percent of people who respond are actually qualified. Its a simple formula. High intent plus perfect timing equals real conversations that convert. This kind of sales isnt loud. Its not spammy, based on listening, not chasing. And it works ! Good luck.

    "content": "Ive built enough SaaS products for clients to know that this is probably the most misunderstood piece of advice in the entire industry. It sounds right. It feels right. And it leads more teams down the wrong path than almost anything else. I know, it sounds like heresy. But let me explain. Every client I work with has a backlog full of feature requests straight from their users. \"We need a dark mode.\" \"Can you add a CSV export button?\" \"We want more dashboard widgets.\" The impulse is always the same: \"Our users are asking for this, so we have to build it.\" And so they do. They build the dark mode, the export button, the extra widgets. And nothing changes. Engagement doesn't go up. Churn doesn't go down. The product just gets more bloated and harder to maintain. Here's the problem nobody talks about: Users are experts at their problems, but they are terrible at designing solutions. When a user asks for a feature, what they're really doing is describing a symptom and guessing at the cure. Your job isn't to be a short-order cook and build whatever they ask for. Your job is to be a doctor and diagnose the underlying disease. I had a client whose users were constantly asking for a \"better way to export data.\" They were convinced they needed more formats, more options, more filters. We spent weeks going back and forth on the design. Finally, I got on the phone with five of those users and asked a simple question: \"What do you do with the data right after you export it?\" Four of them said they manually clean it up and import it into QuickBooks. The problem wasn't the export feature. The problem was they couldn't get their financial data into their accounting software. The real solution wasn't a better export button; it was a native QuickBooks integration. We built that instead, and it became their single biggest driver of upgrades. Here's the framework I use now that saves my clients from themselves: Treat every feature request as a starting point, not an endpoint. The request is the beginning of your investigation, not the conclusion. Always ask \"why\" five times. \"Why do you need a CSV export?\" \"So I can get my data out.\" \"Why do you need to get your data out?\" \"So I can put it in another system.\" \"Why do you need it in that system?\" You get the idea. Watch what they do, not just what they say. Session recordings are gold. You'll often see users struggling with a workflow they can't even articulate properly. Solve the problem, not the request. A user asking for a faster horse doesn't actually want a faster horse. They want to get from point A to point B more quickly. The solution might be a car. I'm not saying you should ignore your users. You absolutely should listen to their problems, their frustrations, and their goals. But the moment you start letting them design your product roadmap, you've already lost. You're the product expert. They're the user expert. Your job is to translate their pain into an elegant solution. Stop taking orders and start diagnosing. Your product will be a thousand times better for it. End of rant. Edit: Damn, this post blew up! If you're struggling with feature bloat or need help building an MVP that actually solves real problems, I'm taking on new clients. Hit me up if you want to cut through the noise and build something people actually need."

    "content": "Hello everyone I just completed a LinkedIn outreach experiment for my SAAS that yielded impressive results: 50%+ acceptance rate and 60% response rate from connections. Here's exactly how I did it. Step 1: Find Your Ideal Prospects Target people who would genuinely benefit from your service. For example, lets say youre aiming at marketers, but this works across industries. The LinkedIn Events strategy: Go to LinkedIn search and type your target industry (marketing) Click on the Events tab Find large events with 10k+ attendees Click Attend Browse the attendee list to identify potential prospects Pro filtering tips : Prioritize younger professionals, who are often more open to trying new tools Step 2: Send Strategic Connection Requests Always use desktop. It lets you add a personalized note, which improves acceptance rates. Keep the message short and simple. Example: Hey [Name], saw we were both in the [industry] space, would love to connect. Best, [Your Name] Step 3: Build Rapport Before Pitching Dont pitch right after someone accepts. Wait. Sometimes theyll even reply first. The next day: Check if they posted recently Like their post and leave a thoughtful comment Make it meaningful (avoid Great post) Step 4: Craft Your Outreach Message Use the problem-first approach. Structure it like this: Greet and reference the connection Mention your app briefly with 1-2 features Ask about their daily challenges Offer value, such as early access, free trial, or a discount Example: Hi [Name], thanks for connecting! Im working on [brief app description]. Im always looking to make it more valuable for [their role]. Whats something you struggle with day-to-day that you wish there was a better solution for? Your insights would be very helpful, and Id love to offer early access if it could help. Step 5: Handle Responses Perfect match: Theyre interested, and your app fits their need Feature opportunity: Theyre not a fit now, but their feedback gives you valuable insights No response/not interested: It happens. This approach still outperforms most others Bonus: Optimize Your Profile Use a clear, professional-looking photo (doesnt need a studio shoot) Write a strong headline and About section that explain what you do Make it easy for prospects to understand your expertise and story Have a website in your bio so prospects can book calls without talking to you Key Takeaways : Quality over quantity: Target the right people Build relationships first: Engage before pitching Focus on problems: Lead with their challenges, not your features Be patient: Genuine outreach takes time Stay authentic: People respond better to real conversations than to polished scripts This system has consistently delivered better results than any other outreach method Ive tried. While no approach works 100% of the time, focusing on relationships and problem-solving creates connections that often turn into long-term business. You can do this 100% manually or automate it at scale. Good luck ! Romn from gojiberry.AI"

My question to the community: as a user, what gives you more confidence  paying monthly with the risk of price increases, or paying once and knowing youre covered forever?"

    "content": "Hey everyone, Im currently building a small micro-SaaS project and considering using Gumroad as my payment provider instead of Stripe or Paddle. I like the idea of handling one-time payments or subscriptions without setting up a complex backend. Im curious:  Has anyone used Gumroad for a micro-SaaS long-term?  How well does it handle subscriptions (cancellations, renewals, reminder emails, etc.)?  How do fees and payouts compare to Stripe/Paddle?  Any issues with refunds, taxes, or support?  Would you still recommend Gumroad in 2025, or go straight for something more professional? Id love to hear honest experiences, lessons learned, or things youd do differently when starting out. Thanks in advance!"

    "content": "Duuude the AI hype is making me feel like I'm living in a different universe... everyone's building \"AI-powered this\" and \"machine learning that\" while I'm over here celebrating that my file upload form works in Safari lmao Like I see posts about \"AI revolutionizing X industry\" and \"GPT wrapper makes $100k MRR\" and I'm just trying to build TuBoost.io without the payment processing breaking when someone uses an apostrophe in their name  Don't get me wrong, my app uses AI for video processing and it's genuinely useful. But 90% of my work is boring shit like database optimization, error handling, and figuring out why the mobile UI looks like garbage on older phones. Meanwhile everyone's raising millions for \"AI agents that do your laundry\" or whatever and I'm wondering if I'm completely missing the boat by focusing on... actually making stuff work? The pressure to be \"AI-first\" is insane though. Like I'll describe TuBoost as \"video processing tool\" and people are like \"cool story bro\" but if I say \"AI-powered content optimization platform\" suddenly everyone's interested. Same exact product, different buzzwords. Had this conversation with another founder who was like \"you should add ChatGPT integration to everything\" and I'm thinking... my users just want their videos to process without errors, they don't need AI to write their video descriptions lol But also what if I'm wrong? What if I should be building chatbots and AI assistants instead of solving actual workflow problems? The FOMO is real and I keep second-guessing whether I'm building the right thing. The funny part is most \"AI startups\" I've seen are just regular software with GPT API calls sprinkled on top. Like we're all using the same OpenAI models but some people are better at marketing it as revolutionary. Anyone else feeling this pressure to AI-ify everything even when it doesn't make sense? Or am I just being stubborn by focusing on core functionality over trendy features? Honestly starting to think the real skill isn't building AI, it's knowing when NOT to use AI and just solve problems with boring reliable technology. But also maybe I'm just coping because I don't understand transformers and everyone else is secretly building AGI while I'm here debugging form validation  What's your take? Are we in an AI bubble or am I missing something fundamental about where software is heading?"

Fixing bugs? Sure. But then I have to actually TELL people about what I built and suddenly I want to crawl into a hole and disappear forever The stuff that's been working (barely): Reddit comments where I actually help people then casually mention my tool Twitter building in public (posting daily even when I feel stupid) Cold emails to YouTubers (95% ignore rate but the 5% who respond are gold) The stuff that makes me want to die: TikTok videos (I look and sound like a robot) \"Networking\" on LinkedIn (feels so fake and gross) Promoting in Discord servers (always worried I'm being spammy) What's weird is when I force myself to be vulnerable and share struggles, people actually respond? Like my posts about failing and being confused get way more engagement than polished \"look at my cool feature\" content. But every single post feels like performing in a play where I don't know my lines. I'll write something, delete it, rewrite it 5 times, then post it and immediately regret it lol. The crazy part is it's actually working though? 35 signups, $700 revenue, 5 people interested in sponsor program. All from forcing myself to be uncomfortably public about everything. Still feels like I'm cosplaying as an entrepreneur while having constant anxiety about whether people think I'm annoying or fake. Anyone else deal with this? Like how do you market your stuff when self-promotion makes you physically uncomfortable? The whole \"just put yourself out there\" advice is useless when \"out there\" feels like standing naked in Times Square lol. What's the least painful marketing strategy you've found? Because I'm running out of ways to procrastinate on promotion"

I know there some alternatives of canny in the market, but still they are charging only 5-10% less than Canny. Im talking serious savings without skimping on the core features that make feedback loops actually useful. Ive been using Canny for my side project and love it, but damn, the pricing adds up quick. If something popped up thats got 70% of the bells and whistles at a fraction of the cost, Id jump on it in a heartbeat. What about you? Would price be the deal-breaker, or are there specific features youd need that might make you stick with the big names? Curious to hear your thoughts, upvote if this sounds intriguing, and drop a comment if youve got recs or experiences! Thanks"
