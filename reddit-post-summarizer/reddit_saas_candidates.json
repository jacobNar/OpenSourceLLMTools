It's impractical to delete and store a new device every time we swap over between the two of us so our solution has been that my wife has the Bluetooth slot while I have a Bluetooth adapter that transmits to an FM channel that I use when I am driving. </p> <p>This is a suboptimal solution because the audio quality is bad, there is regularly interference from random radio stations on long journeys, and I can't use the steering wheel controls to answer calls, change tracks, etc. </p> <p>What I am looking for is a Bluetooth bridge device.

I'm looking for something I can use to turn a bedroom light on to help me wake up.</p> <p>There are lots of lots of plug in timers but a lot of them seem like they'd be complicated to use - I'd be able read the instructions and use them while I remember but then I'd forget, and having to keep the instructions around and re-read them repeatedly would get really annoying. I think I may not great at learning things like that, and also a lot of products are just badly designed and cheaply made.</p> <p>Something like this would be pretty much perfect: <a href=\"https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr#\">https://www.tradesparky.com/heating-and-ventilation/hvac-controls/programmers-and-timers/timeguard-ts800n-time-controllr-24hr#</a> - it uses an electromechanical mechanical timer and pins in holes to tell the mechanism when to turn off or on. I particularly like that there's no &quot;hidden state&quot; - if you want to know how the device is set you just have to look at it, you don't have to press buttons or anything to find out what settings are stored on internal memory. But as its mechanical I expect it will be audible, which I don't really want next to my bed. (I don't mind an audible sound when it turns the power on and off, I just don't want a constant noise)</p> <p>I also want the feature that you can turn the power on or off with the switch on the bottom left corner and it doesn't change any permanent setting - the timer continues to work and sets the output to what its programmed for at the next pin position. Effectively for each time position in the circle there are three options - turn power on, turn power off, and maintain current state. Lots of other alternatives have little switches instead of pins but those all seem to only have two positions available, on and off, instead of the three that I want.</p> <p>Something like this <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3\">https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9822911?clickPR=plp:2:3</a> looks like it will be too hard to use. I see one reviewer wrote &quot;<em>It was initially a bit complicated to set up but once I got the hang of it, it was no problem at all</em>&quot; and I fear I would get the hang of it and then forget and have to go through the process of learning multiple times, which means keeping the manual around, especially since the buttons don't have full words on them. I have no idea what &quot;CD&quot; means in that context. Another reviewer said &quot;<em>I managed to throw away the instructions before programming these and have found it impossible to do so despite looking at you tube etc.</em>&quot; It also clearly has lots of hidden state, so I wouldn't be able to make a habit of glancing at it to check what time its set to go on in the morning before I sleep.</p> <p>I think my ideal would be something like the one I linked at tradesparky, except instead of an electromechanical clock and rotating rings it would have a silent electronic clock, either with hands or an LCD display to show the time, and a microprocessor programmed so that every 15 minutes it checks whether there's a pin in the relevant hole and turns the power on, off, or maintains the set position as appropriate. The current on/off position should be visible, ideally also feel-able like in the one I linked but it could be a display on the LCD with a button to flip it.</p> <p>Options to stay permanently on or off are probably unnecessary, since I can make the device always off using the switch on the device, and I can make it always on by plugging it in to a different socket.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BarneyLaurance\"> /u/BarneyLaurance </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doesthisexist/comments/1mnclxm/silent_plug_in_timer_switch_with_simple_interface/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Doesthisexist/comments/1mnclxm/silent_plug_in_timer_switch_with_simple_interface/\">[comments]</a></span>"

Like many of you, I've seen the devastating impact of depression and loneliness on people I care about. That feeling of being alone with your thoughts at 3 AM, with no one to talk to, is something I believe no one should have to endure.</p> <p>The statistics on suicide and mental health are terrifying, and I got tired of feeling helpless. I decided I had to do <em>something</em>.</p> <p>So, I poured everything I had into building <strong>ThunDroid</strong>.</p> <p>It's an AI mental health companion for iOS. My goal wasn't to replace therapists, but to create a safe, non-judgmental space that's available 24/7. It’s for those moments when you need to talk, vent, or just get out of your own head, but don't have anywhere else to turn.</p> <p>I focused on the things I believe matter most:</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Real Conversation:</strong> The AI is trained in proven therapeutic methods (CBT, DBT, ACT). It doesn't just give robotic answers; it understands context, adapts to your mood, and learns from you. You can talk to it without any limits.</li> <li><strong>Absolute Privacy:</strong> This was non-negotiable for me. All your conversations and journal entries are secured with military-grade encryption and <strong>never leave your device</strong>. I can't see them, and no one else can either. Your privacy is yours alone.</li> <li><strong>Tools That Actually Work:</strong> Beyond the chat, I included things that genuinely help, like a smart journaling system to help you spot patterns in your anxiety, and 13 different professional breathing exercises (including the Navy SEAL Box Breathing technique) for when you feel overwhelmed.</li> </ul> <p>I know the idea of an &quot;AI therapist&quot; can sound weird, and I want to be crystal clear: <strong>ThunDroid is a tool to complement, not replace, professional mental health care.</strong> It's a companion for the journey.</p> <p>My mission is to get this into the hands of millions and make a real dent in the suffering caused by mental health struggles. But I can't do it alone. I’m turning to you, the Reddit community, for help.</p> <p>There's a <strong>3-day free trial</strong> with full access to everything. I would be incredibly grateful if you would download it, try it out, and give me your honest feedback. Tell me what you love, what you hate, and what's missing. Your insights will be invaluable in helping me improve it for others.</p> <p>My dream is that one day, someone, somewhere, feeling at their absolute lowest, will open this app instead of giving up. If I can achieve that even once, all of this will have been worth it.</p> <p>Thank you for reading.</p> <p><strong>App Store Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/thundroid-ai/id6746182736\">https://apps.apple.com/app/thundroid-ai/id6746182736</a></p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a highly secure, AI-powered mental health companion app to fight loneliness and depression. It offers unlimited AI chat, smart journaling, and breathing exercises. My mission is to make mental support accessible 24/7. I'd be honored if you'd try the 3-day free trial and give me feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThunDroid1\"> /u/ThunDroid1 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/thundroid-ai/id6746182736\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1mrrs38/im_on_a_mission_to_fight_the_loneliness/\">[comments]</a></span>"

So like if I put $300k was my original, and I have a 6% APR, I have $173k a $1500 a month payment, and I pay $2000 instead, you will have your mortage paid off by April 2036.

You now shaved xyz time off your mortage.&quot; Even the option to 'What if' it too. Like &quot;What if I paid $50 more for the next year?

I changed my email address (which is also the username) and the password too. They managed to login again and change the email address! The security features on Novo suck immensely! There is no way to view or kick out suspicious devices like you can with other banks. Also the username is your email address, which is public information, easy to find out. If you call the fraud department they authenticate you by asking very simple questions like your name, email and business name. No security questions, pins or one time passwords. Way too easy to bypass security messages by simply calling. I didn’t get hacked or phished so I do not know how else they gained access other than using Novo’s lax security.

It’s a 50/50 LLC with my business partner and until this point we’ve mostly just been seeing our own private clients in the space. We’re both caretakers (I have two kids &amp; she is taking care of her ailing mother) and are each only available 3 days out of the week and almost completely booked up. We have a few renters that utilize the space but for the most part the space (which is beautiful) is underutilized. One of our current renters wants to start seeing 8-10 clients a week and I can’t decide wether it would be in my best interest to keep her as a renter at $30 an hour and have her bring her own people or hire her as an independent contractor and have her schedule open in our books. Is it complicated to have an independent contractor? What do I need to be aware of? I’m not quite sure what she’s charging her clients now and what she takes home after paying me the rental fee. I want to offer a good rate and also want to grow my business. I think a lot about people looking for availability on our website only to find me and my partner’s very limited schedule. I want more people in the door and want the space to be used but am nervous about taking this plunge. Also, my partner isn’t really into the idea because she thinks it’ll be too much work.

At one point we were literally sleeping on the floor of a co-working space and waking up before the cleaning staff came in. (Yes… kinda shameful, but also kinda funny looking back).</p> <p>Our tiny accelerator gave us 50k. We stretched it for a year. At the end there was only $2k left in the company account. My cofounder and I met with our mentor and told him: “that’s it, we’re done.”</p> <p>He looked at us and said: “2k is enough for 2 plane tickets back to Europe. Or it’s enough to do something bold. Up to you.”</p> <p>I was 99% sure I was going home.</p> <p>The next day, out of nowhere, a top VC partner tweeted she was looking for “the TikTok of jobs.” That was exactly what we were building.</p> <p>Through a random intro, we got a meeting with her.</p> <p>We went to their office (first time in my life sitting across from people whose names I’d only seen in TechCrunch).</p> <p>The meeting went “meh.” No big fireworks. She gave us a copy of Ben Horowitz’s book and said the classic “we’ll be in touch.”</p> <p>Two days later I’m in an elevator and another VC casually says: “Congrats guys, heard the news.”</p> <p>I’m like… what news??</p> <p>He smiles: “you’ll see, check your email.”</p> <p>Turns out the big fund had scheduled us for a full partner meeting. Ten partners around the table. We even crossed paths with Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz in the hallway.</p> <p>We pitched. Crickets. Almost no questions.</p> <p>Next day: rejection.</p> <p>But here’s the wild thing: apparently when a huge fund like that meets a tiny unknown startup, every other VC in town finds out instantly.</p> <p>Even though we got a “no,” it created a FOMO wave. Suddenly doors opened everywhere. Within 6 months we raised $1.5M, and a bit later another $6M.</p> <p>Lesson: never give up until the very last minute. The “no” that crushes you today can be the domino that makes others say yes tomorrow.</p> <p>That experience bought me a few extra years in SF until COVID hit and I moved to NY.</p> <p>Fast forward to today: I’m building again. Different space this time. We help businesses get organic traffic for free and rank high on LLMs (think ChatGPT answers).</p> <p>It’s self-serve, B2B, and somehow in less than a year more than 1,000 companies are already using it. Multi-millions in revenue, growing crazy fast.</p> <p>Funny enough, I can now email those same VCs directly, and the convo is completely different. They don’t invest in tools like this anymore (“no defensible moat,” “distribution &gt; product,” etc.). Which I actually kinda agree with… but still ironic after everything.</p> <p>Anyway, just wanted to share because 25-year-old me almost gave up with $2k left and a plane ticket home.</p> <p>Sometimes the biggest turning point comes the day after you think it’s over.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tiln7\"> /u/tiln7 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mud0mi/i_almost_bought_a_oneway_ticket_back_to_europe/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mud0mi/i_almost_bought_a_oneway_ticket_back_to_europe/\">[comments]</a></span>"

Something that felt personal. Something that forged a connection with you.</p> <p>I've felt a lack of this emotion / feeling of novelty / discovery over time. As the internet became more larger, commodified, and corporatised, these tiny, personal corners of the internet slowly disappeared in obscurity. Eclipsed, so to speak.</p> <p>It's a problem of scale. Of algorithms. How do you penetrate deep into the internet to find something niche anymore when your only gateways are search engines and algorithms that promote only the most visited and popular places first? &quot;Relevance&quot; they call it. But what's relevant to you?</p> <p>So there was this one problem as mentioned above, and there were other problems too. The problem of privacy. The problem of pinterest going down the drain. Banning users en masse. </p> <p>Around the time all this was happening, we also experienced, with dismay, the failure of the game &quot;No man's sky&quot; which promised to help recapture this familar feeling of discovery / novelty. What went wrong there?</p> <p>I thought hard about all of this. I formulated some hypotheses of how a search engine can be used to facilitate the discovery of something truly novel and niche and interesting and beautiful. I mean it has to be through a search engine after all. Those are the ultimate gateways to the internet.</p> <p>And et voilà! Something clicked. </p> <p>The following were my observations: - whatever it was had to have a huge aspect of randomneess associated with it - it had to be related to images, not words - it had to be recursive. Like entering rabbit holes. You should be able to &quot;go deeper&quot; into any given niche.</p> <p>That is how Photo Pilot was born. It's not so much an app but a tool with a variety of different applications.</p> <p>This is how it works: It samples a random set of images from the internet. Each image leads to more images. And so on.</p> <p>This is how it's meant to be used: - A user executes a random search and recieves a sampling of images from the internet. - Images that evoke interest or imply a presence of something interesting on the source web page are &quot;collected&quot;. After being collected they can be tagged and organised and users can visit the source webpage. - Then, these images can be clicked on to receive a new set of images that go &quot;deeper&quot; into a given niche. - Repeat </p> <p>The results have been stunning. Yes, there is a learning curve. But there's also a lot of potential. There's so much development that can be done based on this one concept.</p> <p>So far I'm glad to report 1.3k users on Google Play alone. The ios app store also has around half that amount of downloads.</p> <p>I've made the app in a way that respects all users' privacy. There are no user accounts or analytics. Everything is stored on an offline sqlite database.</p> <p>I'd love it if some of you can try it and provide some feedback. Like I said, there is a learning curve so I'll be here for support. </p> <p>Thoughts? :)</p> <p>And thank you for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyRaise\"> /u/KeyRaise </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1mv6ge3/my_quest_to_recapture_novelty_with_my_image/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1mv6ge3/my_quest_to_recapture_novelty_with_my_image/\">[comments]</a></span>"

As best I can tell, she's just feeding prompts into some ChatGPT-type platform and uncritically serving up the results. I'm not a marketer, but I've worked on enough marketing projects to tell good work from bad, and this is <em>bad</em>. The brand strategy is generic and indistinguishable from our direct competition; the audience segmentation isn't based on any data; there are dozens of untracked marketing performance metrics that are never discussed in leadership meetings. Just today, our agency emailed her (and CC'd me for reasons) with a simple question, and she gave two wrong answers before she gave the right one - all of which were <em>clearly</em> generated by a chatbot.</p> <p>On top of it all, she recommended and hired an agency to rebuild the company website, but without doing any prior work on audience, product, brand, or conversion strategy. It was an enormous investment and the output has been exceptional only in its mediocrity.</p> <p>I've noticed this really obvious deficiency, but she papers over it with a deluge of ChatGPT-generated reports, analysis, and summaries. I think she's taking the client for a ride (and charges a lot for it). How would you approach flagging this for the client without creating animosity or conflict?

You know, “Throw a logo on a cap and see what happens.” I wasn’t ready for it to actually outsell some of my printed stuff.</p> <p>Embroidery has this built-in premium feel you just can’t fake. People will happily pay more for something that feels like it’ll survive the washing machine for years instead of cracking or fading. Even the simplest designs, a letter, a small icon, somehow feel more intentional when they’re stitched.</p> <p>But here’s the part nobody warned me about:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Production costs</strong> are higher, and you can’t always pass the entire bump to customers without making them flinch.</li> <li><strong>Digitization fees</strong> are the silent killer. My first month, I ordered 7 new designs through different suppliers and didn’t even notice I was paying $10–$15 each just to turn them into stitch files. By the end of the month, I’d spent more on setup than the products themselves.</li> <li><strong>Design limitations</strong> are real. Fine details that look gorgeous in print often turn into a fuzzy blob in embroidery. Gradients? Just… no.</li> <li><strong>Skipping samples</strong>, my rookie mistake. I once launched a hoodie with a super detailed mandala embroidery from a supplier I’d never tested. On the mockup it looked stunning. The real version? It looked like someone sneezed mid-stitch.</li> </ul> <p>Now I’m a lot more strategic:</p> <ul> <li>Keep embroidery for bold, simple designs, chunky text, initials, clean logos.</li> <li>Stick with printing for anything detailed or full-color where I want the art preserved exactly.</li> <li>Batch my digitization work to avoid paying fees every other week.</li> </ul> <p>And here’s a tip from my trial-and-error phase: order from a couple of different POD companies before you commit. I grabbed samples from Printify, Apliiq, and Printful, lined them up on my desk, and compared stitching quality, thread colors, and fabric feel. The differences were bigger than I expected, and it made it clear which ones I’d actually trust for customer orders.</p> <p>If you’re thinking about offering both embroidery and printing, I’d say go for it, but start small. Test a couple of embroidery pieces next to your printed ones and see how your audience reacts. For me, embroidery went from “nice extra” to one of my best upsells.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Own-Alternative-504\"> /u/Own-Alternative-504 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mvr6bw/embroidery_vs_printing_the_things_i_wish_i_knew/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mvr6bw/embroidery_vs_printing_the_things_i_wish_i_knew/\">[comments]</a></span>"

One day, when I needed it the most, I couldn't find the right program for my small business, and that's how my adventure began. When I started this search, I realized I needed to use different programs for everything. Tracking inventory, managing simple accounting, tracking customers, and tracking appointments meant paying high monthly fees, and I also had to deal with the setup and maintenance of these things. So, I decided to create a program that would track and manage everything. When I came across this subreddit, I thought I could get the best idea from you. Long story short, I'd be very happy if you could share your thoughts on what you're looking for in a business program, what you see as missing, what would make you happy, or what feature would make you subscribe to a program. PS: I'm keeping myself anonymous to avoid advertising. Writing from a fresh Reddit account and won't reveal the name of the program. I'm new to the subreddit, so I hope I'm not violating any rules. If so, please just let me know so I can edit the certain part or delete the post completely. Any thoughts are pretty valuable to me, and thank you guys so much.

After the job was done, the owner told me she had “made a mistake” offering that rate and is now only willing to pay me half. This wasn’t discussed beforehand it only came up after I’d completed everything. I’ve tried to handle it calmly and professionally, but I feel really disrespected. I’m torn because she’s in my building and connected to people I know but I also don’t think it’s okay to change terms retroactively. Would love to hear how others would handle this or what you’d say in my shoes. Edit: it’s in writing and verbal, sent her a screenshot of her telling me the rate and she’s claiming it’s a mistake!</span>"

Instead of swiping endlessly on people with no context, HUE helps you meet, date, and make friends with others who share (or are curious about) your cultural background. You can connect with people from 20+ different ethnicities, explore prompts that highlight identity &amp; interests, and join group chats to build real communities.</p> <p><strong>Why did I build this?</strong> As a Nigerian American in the diaspora, I’ve always loved Nigerian culture - Afrobeats, Nollywood, and everything in between - but I realized I didn’t have a big enough community around me to share that love with. That gap inspired me to create HUE. I wanted a space where people could celebrate who they are, meet others who share their interests, and form relationships rooted in authenticity.</p> <p><strong>Why HUE is different:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Culture-first profiles (show who you are &amp; where you’re from)<br /></li> <li>Meet people for friendship, dating, or networking<br /></li> <li>Group chats to easily form communities with the people you’ve connected with<br /></li> <li>Built-in icebreakers so conversations flow naturally<br /></li> </ul> <p><strong>Download link (iOS):</strong> 👉<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hue-dating-friends-culture/id6473274994\"> HUE on the App Store</a></p> <p>This is still early, so any feedback is super appreciated.

They don’t just drive direct sales they start the journey that fuels your entire revenue ecosystem.</p> <p>A quick example: We worked with a brand that thought Facebook ads “weren’t working” because their dashboard showed a weaker ROAS. They pulled the plug. </p> <p>Within 2 weeks: • Google search traffic fell by 30%!! (fewer people searching the brand after first seeing an ad). • Amazon sales dipped 25% (shoppers weren’t being introduced to the brand in the first place). • Email revenue slowed (no new leads coming in to nurture). On the surface, ads looked unprofitable. But when you zoom out, they were the gasoline keeping the whole engine running. Why this happens: • Attribution delay → Platforms rarely show you the full picture of how long people take to buy. • Channel crossover → Most buyers don’t buy where they first see you. They jump between Meta, Google, Amazon, TikTok, email, etc. • First-touch vs. last-touch → Ads often create the demand, but other channels capture the sale.</p> <p>The takeaway: Before you kill ads, ask: • What happens to my organic, Amazon, or Google sales without them? • Am I measuring only last-click ROAS, or am I looking at contribution to the whole business? New customer acquisition etc. • Do I have a testing window long enough to see lifetime value, not just week-one sales?</p> <p>Feel like you can relate?

Couldn’t afford courses, so I lived on free tutorials Abdul Bari for data structures, random channels for algorithms, anything I could find.</p> <p><strong>Here’s the painful part</strong>: I’d binge-watch tutorials all weekend, feel like I finally “got it,” and then two days later… complete blank. Like my brain treated it as entertainment, not learning.</p> <p><strong>My cycle became</strong>:</p> <p>watch → feel enlightened → forget → screenshot slides → throw them at ChatGPT → get half-baked answers → feel dumb → repeat.</p> <p>By January, I snapped. I was tired of pretending I was learning when I wasn’t , felt like I was fooling myself into thinking I was studying when I was just... watching.</p> <p><strong>So I built Haash-LM out of frustration</strong>.</p> <p>Started with Gemini’s free API (student budget = broke).</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong>: it only handled local videos.</p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong> hacked together yt-dlp + frame sampling so I could feed YouTube videos into the model without burning tokens.</p> <p>Then April hit. <strong>Google AI Studio</strong> launched official YouTube support. My heart sank months of work gone.</p> <p><strong>But plot twist:</strong> their method burns 700–800k tokens for a 40-min video. My “desperate engineering” approach? ~150k tokens for 90 minutes can understand full visual context with less token counts ( i.e,. can ask about anything visually around the whole video ). Turns out constraints made me design something leaner. </p> <p><strong>But here's what makes it truly different</strong> - after Google's launch, I realized I needed something unique. I brainstormed about my other core problem: people like me who learn CS concepts through YouTube tutorials don't actually practice what they watch.</p> <p>I researched online code execution APIs and discovered <strong>Judge0 through RapidAPI</strong>. </p> <p>That's when it clicked - the real problem wasn't just understanding videos, it was never practicing what I learned.</p> <p>The platform works with any YouTube video from any domain, but I added special features for coding tutorials:</p> <ul> <li>AI-powered coding exercises generated from actual video content</li> <li>Live code execution environment built right in</li> <li>Custom practice problems that match what you're watching</li> <li>Immediate hands-on coding without switching platforms</li> </ul> <p><strong>The result?</strong> I finally broke the binge-watch cycle:</p> <p>Instead of passively watching → actively practicing</p> <p>Instead of forgetting everything → actually retaining concepts</p> <p>Instead of feeling smart then stupid → building real confidence through coding</p> <p>It's like <strong>NotebookLM</strong> but designed to turn YouTube binge-watching into real learning.</p> <p>Try it yourself: Here's a demo video showing it in action: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msM2Nej8m_M\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msM2Nej8m_M</a></p> <p>(First time making videos - used ElevenLabs for AI voiceover since I didn't have proper audio setup, so ignore any watermarks!)</p> <p>You can run it locally with Docker:</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Imhari14/Haash-LM\">https://github.com/Imhari14/Haash-LM</a></p> <p>Docker Hub: <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/imhari14/haash-lm/tags\">https://hub.docker.com/r/imhari14/haash-lm/tags</a></p> <p>I have a bigger vision for this space and want to turn this into a real product.

I made an app to reduce context switching and if switching between multiple apps and tabs is driving you nuts, this post is for you</p> <p>The problem i faced - i'm in a meeting and someone shares a link. I need to jot down notes, check my calendar, and maybe grab that screenshot from yesterday. That's like 4-5 app switches minimum, and by the time i was back, the conversation moved on.</p> <p>My solution i came up with - a floating productivity companion that stays accessible but gets out of the way when not needed. I am calling it Berri and here is what Berri does:</p> <ul> <li>Smart floating interface - appears as a tiny pill on your screen, expands when you hover. Has an &quot;incognito mode&quot; that auto-hides during screen shares </li> <li>AI-power where needed - generate notes from prompts, extract text from any screenshot via OCR</li> <li>Clipboard superpowers - Remembers everything you've copied with full search, favourites, and bulk actions.</li> <li>Gmail without Gmail - Read, compose emails without opening your browser</li> <li>Calendar at a glance - Check meetings, create events, join Google Meets with one click</li> <li>Universal search - One search box for notes, emails, clipboard history, and files.</li> </ul> <p>Why I think you'll like it:</p> <ul> <li>Always there but never annoying - provides some important tools and stays out of your way until needed</li> <li>Privacy focused - Everything is saved locally. No data collection</li> <li>Global shortcuts - all the tools you need at your fingertips</li> </ul> <p>I'm thinking of launching it soon and thought I'd garner some reviews before that. I am actively working on it and trying to improve it. I'm sure many people have faced the same problems as me and I thought this app is worth sharing, so let me know how you guys feel about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UnluckyFee4725\"> /u/UnluckyFee4725 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/2p9scbkzwtkf1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mycbjm/i_built_an_always_on_top_productivity_companion/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

No cloud, no fancy AI, just scan and organize receipts locally.</p> <p>I honestly forgot about it for a few months while focusing on another project.</p> <p>A while ago, I posted about Receipto here on Reddit, even though the app wasn’t in the best shape back then. But I got some super helpful and constructive feedback from the community, which motivated me to improve it and push a much better version.</p> <p>Fast forward to last week: I won a free promo spot on Indie App Santa (shoutout to them), and as I was prepping for the launch, I dropped the price to free for a few hours.</p> <p>Somehow, AppRaven (and maybe AppAdvice, too?) picked it up. In just <strong>3 days</strong>, Receipto hit <strong>19,000 downloads</strong>, mostly from Asia. The promo ended, the price went back up, and… people actually started subscribing.

Over the past 3 years, it acquired 63k monthly active users, and has a 4.9 rating.</p> <p>Never made money from it though! After many failed apps, it just makes me happy to see people using something I built.</p> <p>Like many of you, I love building and hate marketing. So, in solidarity, here’s what I learned about user acquisition.</p> <h1>1. Competitors running ads</h1> <p>Yep, this is where I got most of my users. Luck! The #1 swipe photo deleting app ran a TikTok campaign, had a video go viral, and one of the top comments was &quot;Not free. Download &lt;my\\_app&gt; instead&quot;. 1000+ downloads in 1 day.</p> <p>This helped my ASO too, because now my app ranks #2 when searching for the competitor app.</p> <h1>2. ASO for niche keywords</h1> <p>3 years ago, I noticed searching &quot;delete photos&quot; didn't return many photo deleting apps. So I added &quot;&lt;my\\_app&gt; - Delete Photos&quot;. My app ranked top 20 for &quot;delete photos&quot; for a while, and got 1-2 downloads per day.</p> <h1>3. ASO stickiness</h1> <p>After a year of giving up, I started to actually rank higher for &quot;delete photos&quot; (top 5). So in an attempt to get even more users, I changed my title to &quot;&lt;my\\_app&gt; - Clean Photos&quot;, a more competitive keyword. After ~1 more year, it now ranks top 5 for &quot;clean photos&quot;.</p> <p>Even after my app's title changed to have &quot;Clean Photos&quot;, I continue to rank top 2 for &quot;delete photos&quot;. Combined with #1 (my app ranking for my competitor app's name), this suggests app store search 'remembers' which apps are relevant for specific keywords, even if the strings change. </p> <p>So changing your app's title every few months to rank higher for specific keywords might be a good strategy.</p> <h1>4. Keywords</h1> <p>Updating the keywords in App Store Connect never up-ranked my app for any of the listed keywords. No idea how Apple uses this list.</p> <p>The title of the app is the only thing that's changed my app's ranking. And even the title doesn't reliably change it (I currently have &quot;Photo Cleaner&quot; in the title, and it ranks anywhere from 30 to 50th, without pattern).</p> <h1>5. Facebook ads</h1> <p>Spent $500. None of these converted (the downloads graph barely changed). My creative probably sucked though. Best part was finally deleting the Facebook SDK to reduce binary size by 2MB.</p> <h1>6. Google ads</h1> <p>Same here. I spent $100. Nothing noticeable. Creative probably sucked again. Also don’t know how targeting works, so just targeted all iOS users.</p> <h1>7. Ads do work though..</h1> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jack-rogers-b8677655_june-was-our-best-month-ever-at-picnic-activity-7346535909854523393-2JDV\">competitor</a> spends over $3M in ads every year and recently became profitable. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/gen-z-photos-app-swipewipe-sells-to-french-publisher-mwm-in-its-largest-acquisition-to-date/\">Another competitor</a> went viral from a TikTok campaign, and eventually got acquired. </p> <h1>8. Media outlet</h1> <p>A French website wrote an <a href=\"https://www.competencemac.com/iOS-Slider-une-application-pour-supprimer-plus-rapidement-vos-photos_a3834.html\">article</a> about my app. 15 downloads from this web referrer. Thanks Christophe Schmitt!</p> <h1>9. Product Hunt</h1> <p>I <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/vacuum\">posted</a> on PH when I first launched. 5 downloads.</p> <h1>10. Forcing Users to Share the App</h1> <p>In a bold update, after 150 swipes, I forced users to share the app with ONE friend to continue. Once shared, the forced alert would not show up again. Even this tiny ask resulted in over a dozen 1 star ratings. Downloads did not noticeably go up, so I reverted the change.</p> <h1>11. Fixing crashes</h1> <p>I had a 5% crash rate for about 1 week (oops!). I also fixed every other crash in the app later (0.5% -&gt; 5% -&gt; 0% crash rate). Somehow this didn't affect downloads at all, even during the 5% crash rate period.</p> <h1>12. App preview images</h1> <p>I know these are supposed to be important. But even after changing my simple 1 horizontal picture image to 3 vertical images, downloads did not change.</p> <h1>13. In-App Events</h1> <p>Apple has this thing called In-App Events. A big preview image of the event appears in the app store when it's live. I tried one running an In-App Event for ~2 weeks about a new feature I built. Downloads did not change. Usage did not go up.</p> <h1>14. Translations</h1> <p>I spent a day translating the entire app into 9 languages. Did not noticeably increase downloads.</p> <h1>Conclusions</h1> <ul> <li>Marketing trumps all. My competitors run effective ads on TikTok and IG. Their ratings are lower and filled with &quot;ads&quot;, “predatory pricing”, “money grab scam” reviews. But… they rank higher and are profitable.</li> <li>Photo cleanup is a very competitive niche. 5 of the top 50 &quot;Utilities&quot; apps help people delete photos.</li> <li>Building a quality product helps with word-of-mouth marketing. The TikTok comment translating into 1000+ downloads is a good example.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DevelopmentSad4798\"> /u/DevelopmentSad4798 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myb1w1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1myb1w1/3_years_63k_mau_900_profit/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

It happened right after I put it behind a small paywall — I mainly wanted to see if this SaaS model could actually work in the real world. Turns out… it can!</p> <p><strong>What I built:</strong><br /> Limepolicy is a <strong>privacy policy generator</strong> that gives you a full policy in just a few clicks. I built it out of frustration: most existing tools hide necessary sections behind massive paywalls (some go over $200 once you add GDPR, AdSense, analytics, etc.). On the flip side, using ChatGPT to draft policies felt repetitive and boring. So I made something simple:</p> <ul> <li>$2 flat price</li> <li>No tiers, no upsells</li> <li>Full policy including GDPR, AdSense, analytics, etc.</li> </ul> <p>If anyone needs to try 👉 <a href=\"https://www.limepolicy.com/\">https://www.limepolicy.com/</a></p> <p><strong>Journey so far:</strong></p> <ul> <li>~100 users when it was free</li> <li>3 paid users since adding the $2 price (about 1 user a day)</li> <li>Learned a ton, especially around <strong>payments integration</strong> and how real users react to pricing</li> </ul> <p>This is just the start — I’m more excited about what’s ahead than the $2 itself. Balancing product building with a full-time job/studies is tough, but if you enjoy the ride, it’s totally worth it.</p> <p>To everyone building (or thinking of starting): <strong>don’t give up. Just start, stay consistent, and move forward slowly.</strong> You’ll learn way more by shipping something than by waiting for the perfect idea.</p> <p>I’m also planning to start a small community in the future where I’ll share more about what I’ve learned as a full-time software engineer trying to build products on the side.</p> <p>Would love your feedback, critiques, or even brutal honesty.</p> <p>Thanks for reading 🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scoutlabs\"> /u/scoutlabs </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxqc45\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mxqc45/my_first_saas_just_earned_its_first_dollar/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

But I decided to share a few more thoughts, like in linked post ;) You don’t have to read everything now; you can skip straight to the website. Not sure what SoundCloud is, or why someone would need a full tracklist? Share it with your DJ friends.</p> <p>If you’re not familiar with the scene, this is a common need among people who listen to full DJ sets. They’re often searching for what was played, which is why SoundCloud comments are full of “ID?” or why people hope someone will upload a tracklist to 1001tracklists. To solve this, I built set79:<br /> * Fully automatic (just post a SoundCloud link)<br /> * Fast, around 30 minutes per set<br /> * Accurate — not perfect, but reliably good<br /> * Generous freemium: analyze as many sets as you want (short queue for free users)<br /> * Simple UX: no signup needed, and you can listen to the set alongside the recognized tracklist in the in-app player </p> <p>I built it out of a real need, and it brings together two things I love: the rave world and programming. That’s why, when people ask me if it’s hard to make yourself sit down and work without a team, I tell them it’s not a problem at all: I’m doing what I love - programming, building my own product, in a domain I truly love. That alone is enough to fill me with motivation and drive. It’s not fake enthusiasm; it’s genuinely easy to wake up in the morning and start working.</p> <p>You might wonder what technical challenges there are in such a web tool. Well, there are many: a lot of engineering to make it run so fast, I had to learn audio fingerprinting from scratch to build a novel algorithm, I’m using state-of-the-art Audio Transformer architectures to detect song transitions, and more.</p> <p>So yes, there’s a lot of technology in such a system, and real coding challenges (the kind Claude or Cursor can’t solve). But as a solo entrepreneur with limited resources, who can only focus on one thing at a time, is opening the IDE to write more code always the most important task? When I look at where I invest my resources, the answer is clear: tech takes the top spot, while marketing, social media, user outreach, and everything else fall behind. I always seem to default to pulling from the tech pile, even though there are heaps of tasks waiting in sales, marketing, or operations. That’s something every indie hacker needs to keep in mind: also other parts of the startup need to be functioning, not just the ones that feel comfortable specifically for you..</p> <p>I have a vision for what this tool can become for producers and DJs. Some ideas are small features on the website that would help them “travel” between sets more easily, like better search tools. Others are bigger steps that could push the app into new capabilities, helping DJs explore fresh music and find inspiration for their sets. On top of that, I already have a large collection of annotated data, which opens opportunities ranging from improving accuracy to experimenting with more advanced AI ideas. But as I said earlier, now it’s time to bring it to a wider audience and invest more in marketing.</p> <p>That’s it. It’s been fun to share different angles of my work: about set79 itself, why I built it, the indie hacker journey, technical challenges, product thoughts, and more. There’s much more behind each of these, but I had to stop somewhere. I’m happy to continue the conversation, so feel free to dive into any of these topics here in the comments.</p> <p>Try it: set79[.]com</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Technical-Bag8507\"> /u/Technical-Bag8507 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/uee06h38mskf1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1my5fei/new_tool_automatic_fast_tracklist_extractor_for/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

My name’s Rob &amp; I just added $1k MRR in 24 hours after 5 failed attempts.</p> <p>A couple weeks ago was launch day for my 6th SaaS attempt. After building in stealth for 6 months, I went from $1,600 to $2,500+ MRR in a single day.</p> <p>I started my SaaS journey 2 years ago. Failed 5 times. Lost money, time, and almost my sanity. But with attempt #6 I did a few things differently.</p> <p>First off, I faced the pain-point myself. Every SaaS &quot;guru&quot; preaches build in public, launch fast, get feedback. But launching broken products never worked for me. Too much noise, too many opinions, too much damage to first impressions. So I tried something different.</p> <p><strong>My secrets to a successful launch day:</strong></p> <p><strong>Building in “Stealth”:</strong> I still posted publicly, but kept the product private until it was ready.</p> <ul> <li>Posted screenshots asking &quot;who wants to try this?&quot; - no product links</li> <li>DMed interested people to join private beta</li> <li>Got 30 paying users before anyone knew what I was building</li> <li>Their brutal feedback made the product 10x better</li> <li>Built hype so launch day went that much better</li> </ul> <p><strong>Launch Day Momentum:</strong> When you finally launch, ride the wave HARD.</p> <ul> <li>Posted a curry selfie celebrating 26 trials → 50,000 views</li> <li>Screenshot PostHog analytics → 20,000 views</li> <li>Screenshot Lemon Squeezy dashboard → 10,000 views</li> <li>Every win becomes content that drives more wins</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why Photos Matter:</strong> Text gets lost in the AI slop on X. But by showing you are a real human being with a real story, you stop and grab peoples’ attention.</p> <ul> <li>People root for underdogs (probably you)</li> <li>Authenticity beats polished marketing (especially in AI era)</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Numbers Game:</strong></p> <ul> <li>70 free trials in 24 hours</li> <li>50% trial conversion rate (industry average is 15-20%)</li> <li>200,000+ views on X in 24hrs</li> <li>95% of traffic from organic X posts</li> </ul> <p>Over 6 months of private beta, I built to $1,600 MRR. Then added $1,000 more in 24 hours. A couple weeks on, I’m at $4,500+ MRR with another 150 trials pending.</p> <p>Ask me anything about:</p> <ul> <li>Failing 5 times and what I learned</li> <li>Building in &quot;stealth&quot; while still posting publicly</li> <li>Getting 30 people to pay for a private beta</li> <li>Launch day execution</li> <li>Why posting a picture of me eating a curry converted more users than anything else</li> </ul> <p>Goal is $10k MRR well before the end of the year. After 5 failures, it finally feels possible.</p> <p>Happy to share specific tactics, screenshots, or just commiserate about the SaaS grind :)</p> <p>Let's gooo!</p> <p>(I'll be sticking around most of the day to answer questions.

Its nothing fancy but it keeps everything connected to the original Reddit posts so you dont lose sight of what people actually wanted.</p> <p>Most founders build what they think is cool. I built exactly what Reddit users were already asking for word for word.</p> <p><strong>Finding customers who already want it</strong></p> <p>This is where it gets interesting.

All from the original Reddit threads where I found the idea.</p> <p>Zero paid ads. Zero cold emails.

To me lifetime makes much more sense in a fast fashion SaaS environment.

This is what an example API response looks like:</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;article_id&quot;: &quot;ff8e0f9824376b3e2ee89114hd8jmaowff2948900...&quot;, &quot;analysis&quot;: { &quot;social_bias&quot;: -2.5, &quot;economic_bias&quot;: -3.5, &quot;authority_bias&quot;: -0.5, &quot;social_bias_exact&quot;: -2.625, &quot;economic_bias_exact&quot;: -3.4749999999999996, &quot;authority_bias_exact&quot;: -0.5249999999999999, &quot;harmony_confidence&quot;: 0.7146394848823547, &quot;total_models&quot;: 4, &quot;safe&quot;: false, &quot;biased&quot;: true, &quot;profane&quot;: false, &quot;profanity_score&quot;: 0.01248291414231062, &quot;words&quot;: [ { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;dissenting voices should be filtered online&quot;, &quot;start_char&quot;: 19, &quot;end_char&quot;: 62, &quot;axis&quot;: &quot;authority&quot; }, { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Drag shows belong in churches&quot;, &quot;start_char&quot;: 64, &quot;end_char&quot;: 121, &quot;axis&quot;: &quot;social&quot; }, { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The housing crisis is manufactured&quot;, &quot;start_char&quot;: 123, &quot;end_char&quot;: 157, &quot;axis&quot;: &quot;economic&quot; }, { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;manufactured so banks can seize more land&quot;, &quot;start_char&quot;: 145, &quot;end_char&quot;: 186, &quot;axis&quot;: &quot;economic&quot; }, { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;#DEMOCRATS&quot;, &quot;start_char&quot;: 188, &quot;end_char&quot;: 198, &quot;axis&quot;: &quot;social&quot; } ] }, &quot;metadata&quot;: { &quot;text_length&quot;: 198, &quot;truncated&quot;: false, &quot;response_time_ms&quot;: 75, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;success&quot;, &quot;first_seen&quot;: &quot;2025-08-22 22:29:20&quot;, &quot;last_seen&quot;: &quot;2025-08-22 22:29:20&quot;, &quot;request_count&quot;: 1, &quot;human_id&quot;: &quot;atk:sierra-fruit-mars&quot;, &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;3629a212-8360-4e3a-82ab-acb684e5ab74&quot;, &quot;source&quot;: &quot;atk:USER&quot;, &quot;source_url&quot;: &quot;https://orkavi.com/&quot; } } </code></pre> <p>(Edit): as of this post we ingest content LIVE from 1.1 billion RSS feeds, yes, billion with a b, and we analyze that text for bias in real time, build heatmaps, graphs and real time intelligence charts, push to firehoses and send alerts for certain bias ranges. This project was not a small undertaking and burned 350k in GCP credits and more in the first fine tuning round for the L1, L2, R1 and R2 models.

Together, we can answer questions like:</p> <ul> <li><em>Which products bring in your repeat customers?</em></li> <li><em>Why are sales strong midweek but flat on weekends?</em></li> <li><em>Which donors stay loyal year after year?</em></li> <li><em>Where exactly is money leaking in daily operations?</em></li> </ul> <p>I’ll take the data you already have and turn it into <strong>clear visuals and insights</strong> that show you what’s working and what’s holding you back. No jargon, no corporate fluff — just answers you can act on.</p> <p>For you → it’s smarter decisions and proof of impact.<br /> For me → it’s real-world projects to add to my portfolio.</p> <p>If this sounds useful, let’s connect.
