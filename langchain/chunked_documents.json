(a) In General.--Section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. 1396b(w)) is amended--\n        (1) in paragraph (3)(E), by inserting after clause (ii)(II) the \n    following new clause:\n    ``(iii) For purposes of clause (ii)(I), a tax is not considered to \nbe generally redistributive if any of the following conditions apply:\n        ``(I) Within a permissible class, the tax rate imposed on any \n    taxpayer or tax rate group (as defined in paragraph (7)(J)) \n    explicitly defined by its relatively lower volume or percentage of \n    Medicaid taxable units (as defined in paragraph (7)(H)) is lower \n    than the tax rate imposed on any other taxpayer or tax rate group \n    explicitly defined by its relatively higher volume or percentage of \n    Medicaid taxable units. ``(II) Within a permissible class, the tax rate imposed on any \n    taxpayer or tax rate group (as so defined) based upon its Medicaid \n    taxable units (as so defined) is higher than the tax rate imposed \n    on any taxpayer or tax rate group based upon its non-Medicaid \n    taxable unit (as defined in paragraph (7)(I)). ``(III) The tax excludes or imposes a lower tax rate on a \n    taxpayer or tax rate group (as so defined) based on or defined by \n    any description that results in the same effect as described in \n    subclause (I) or (II) for a taxpayer or tax rate group. Characteristics that may indicate such type of exclusion include \n    the use of terminology to establish a tax rate group--\n            ``(aa) based on payments or expenditures made under the \n        program under this title without mentioning the term `Medicaid' \n        (or any similar term) to accomplish the same effect as \n        described in subclause (I) or (II); or\n            ``(bb) that closely approximates a taxpayer or tax rate \n        group under the program under this title, to the same effect as \n        described in subclause (I) or (II).''; and\n        (2) in paragraph (7), by adding at the end the following new \n    subparagraphs:\n        ``(H) The term `Medicaid taxable unit' means a unit that is \n    being taxed within a health care related tax that is applicable to \n    the program under this title. Such term includes a unit that is \n    used as the basis for--\n            ``(i) payment under the program under this title (such as \n        Medicaid bed days);\n            ``(ii) Medicaid revenue;\n            ``(iii) costs associated with the program under this title \n        (such as Medicaid charges, claims, or expenditures); and\n            ``(iv) other units associated with the program under this \n        title, as determined by the Secretary. ``(I) The term `non-Medicaid taxable unit' means a unit that is \n    being taxed within a health care related tax that is not applicable \n    to the program under this title. Such term includes a unit that is \n    used as the basis for--\n            ``(i) payment by non-Medicaid payers (such as non-Medicaid \n        bed days);\n            ``(ii) non-Medicaid revenue;\n            ``(iii) costs that are not associated with the program \n        under this title (such as non-Medicaid charges, non-Medicaid \n        claims, or non-Medicaid expenditures); and\n            ``(iv) other units not associated with the program under \n        this title, as determined by the Secretary. ``(J) The term `tax rate group' means a group of entities \n    contained within a permissible class of a health care related tax \n    that are taxed at the same rate.''.

(a) In General.--Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(g) Requirement of Budget Neutrality for Medicaid Demonstration \nProjects.--\n        ``(1) In general.--Beginning January 1 2027, the Secretary may \n    not approve an application for (or renewal or amendment of) an \n    experimental, pilot, or demonstration project undertaken under \n    subsection (a) to promote the objectives of title XIX in a State \n    (in this subsection referred to as a `Medicaid demonstration \n    project') unless the Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare & \n    Medicaid Services certifies that such project, or, in the case of a \n    renewal, the duration of the preceding waiver, is not expected to \n    result in an increase in the amount of Federal expenditures \n    compared to the amount that such expenditures would otherwise be in \n    the absence of such project. For purposes of this subsection, \n    expenditures for the coverage of populations and services that the \n    State could have otherwise provided through its Medicaid State plan \n    or other authority under title XIX, including expenditures that \n    could be made under such authority but for the provision of such \n    services at a different site of service than authorized under such \n    State plan or other authority, shall be considered expenditures in \n    the absence of such a project. ``(2) Treatment of savings.--In the event that expenditures \n    with respect to a State under a Medicaid demonstration project are, \n    during an approval period for such project, less than the amount of \n    such expenditures that would have otherwise been made in the \n    absence of such project, the Secretary shall specify the \n    methodology to be used with respect to the subsequent approval \n    period for such project for purposes of taking the difference \n    between such expenditures into account.''. (b) Implementation Funding.--For the purposes of carrying out the \nprovisions of, and the amendments made by, this section, there are \nappropriated, out of any monies in the Treasury not otherwise \nappropriated, to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027, \nto remain available until expended.
